         CERTIORARI        TO   THE     SUPREME        COURT      OF   OKLAHOMA


   No.    78-1078.     Argued     October     3,  1979-Decided        January     21,   1980


 A  products-liability     action   was   instituted   in  an   Oklahoma      state  court   by
   respondents      husband    and   wife  to  recover    for  personal   injuries   sustained
   in   Oklahoma      in  an   accident    involving     an   automobile     that   had   been
   purchased     by them      in New     York   while   they   were   New    York    residents
   and   that   was   being   driven    through    Oklahoma      at  the  time   of  the  acci-
   dent.    The defendants        included    the   automobile     retailer  and    its whole-
   saler    (petitioners),    New     York    corporations      that   did   no   business    in
   Oklahoma.        Petitioners   entered    special  appearances,     claiming    that  Okla-
   homa's     exercise   of  jurisdiction    over   them    would    offend   limitations    on
   the    State's   jurisdiction    imposed     by   the   Due    Process    Clause     of  the
   Fourteenth      Amendment.         The    trial  court   rejected    petitioners'    claims,
   and    they   then   sought,    but   were   denied,   a   writ  of   prohibition    in  the
   Oklahoma       Supreme      Court     to   restrain    respondent      trial  judge    from
   exercising   in personam jurisdiction        over  them.
Held:    Consistently    with   the  Due    Process   Clause,   the  Oklahoma      trial  court
   may    not  exercise  in personam jurisdiction        over   petitioners.    Pp. 291-299.
      (a)   A  state   court   may    exercise   personal    jurisdiction   over   a  nonresi-
   dent    defendant     only   so  long   as   there   exist   "minimum       contacts"    be-
   tween    the   defendant     and   the  forum     State.    International Shoe       Co.   v.
   Washington,      326   U.   S. 310.    The    defendant's    contacts with      the  forum
   State   must    be  such    that  maintenance      of  the   suit  does   not  offend   tra-
   ditional   notions   of  fair play    and  substantial    justice,  id., at  316,  and   the
   relationship    between     the   defendant     and   the   forum    must   be   such   that
   it is "reasonable     . . .  to require   the corporation to      defend    the  particular
   suit  which   is  brought    there,"  id., at  317.   The Due      Process   Clause   "does
   not contemplate       that  a state   may   make    binding   a  judgment     in personam
   against    an  individual    or  corporate defendant        with   which    the   state  has
   no  contacts,   ties, or  relations."    Id.,  at 319.    Pp. 291-294.
       (b)  Here, there      is a  total  absence    in  the   record   of  those   affiliating
   circumstances      that   are  a  necessary     predicate    to any    exercise   of  state-
   court    jurisdiction.     Petitioners     carry    on   no   activity    whatsoever       in
   Oklahoma;       they    close  no   sales  and    perform     no   services   there,   avail

   themselves     of  none   of   the  benefits   of  Oklahoma      law,  and   solicit  no
   business   there   either  through    salespersons    or  through     advertising   rea-
   sonably calculated  sellto  reach  that  State.    Nor   does  the  record   show   that
   they   regularly        cars  to  Oklahoma      residents   or  that  they   indirectly,
   through    others,  serve  or  seek  to  serve  the  Oklahoma     market.     Although
   it is  foreseeable    that  automobiles     sold  by   petitioners   would    travel  to
   Oklahoma      and   that  the   automobile     here  might    cause   injury  in  Okla-
   homa,    "foreseeability"    alone  is not   a  sufficient benchmark      for  personal
   jurisdiction   under    the  Due   Process    Clause.    The   foreseeability   that   is
   critical to  due  process   analysis  is not the   mere   likelihood   that  a product
   will find  its way   into  the  forum   State, but   rather is  that  the  defendant's
   conduct    and   connection    with   the   forum   are  such   that   he  should   rea-
   sonably    anticipate   being   haled   into court    there.   Nor    can  jurisdiction
   be  supported     on  the   theory   that   petitioners   earn   substantial   revenue
   from goods used in      Oklahoma.      Pp. 295-299.

   MR.    JUSTICE      WHITE       delivered      the   opinion      of  the   Court.
   The     issue   before     us  is  whether,      consistently       with    the   Due
Process     Clause     of  the    Fourteenth        Amendment,          an   Oklahoma
court    may     exercise     in   personam       jurisdiction       over   a   nonresi-
dent    automobile         retailer    and    its   wholesale       distributor      in   a
products-liability         action,    when      the   defendants'       only    connec-
tion   with     Oklahoma        is  the    fact   that    an   automobile        sold   in
New      York     to   New     York      residents      became       involved      in   an
accident      in  Oklahoma.

286                           Opinion   of the  Court
York.      It  distributes     vehicles,    parts,   and   accessories,     under
 contract   with   Volkswagen, to       retail   dealers   in New    York,   New
Jersey, and      Connecticut.        Seaway,    one   of  these   retail  dealers,
 is incorporated       and   has   its  place   of  business    in   New    York.
 Insofar    as  the   record    reveals,   Seaway      and    World-Wide        are
fully    independent       corporations       whose     relations    with     each
other    and    with   Volkswagen       and    Audi are     contractual      only.
Respondents        adduced     no  evidence     that  either   World-Wide        or
Seaway      does   any    business    in   Oklahoma,       ships   or  sells   any
products to      or  in  that   State,   has   an  agent    to  receive   process
there,   or  purchases     advertisements       in  any  media calculated        to
reach    Oklahoma.        In   fact,  as  respondents'      counsel    conceded
at  oral   argument,      Tr.  of  Oral   Arg.   32,  there   was   no   showing
that   any   automobile      sold  by   World-Wide       or  Seaway     has   ever
entered     Oklahoma       with    the  single    exception     of  the   vehicle
involved in     the  present    case.
   Despite     the    apparent     paucity     of   contacts    between      peti-
tioners    and   Oklahoma,      the   District   Court    rejected    their   con-
stitutional     claim   and   reaffirmed     that   ruling   in  denying     peti-
tioners' motion       for  reconsideration.'        Petitioners    then    sought
a  writ   of  prohibition     in  the   Supreme      Court    of  Oklahoma      to
restrain the     District    Judge,    respondent      Charles    S.  Woodson,
from    exercising     in  personam       jurisdiction    over    them.     They
renewed     their   contention     that, because     they   had   no   "minimal
contacts,"     App.    32,  with   the  State    of  Oklahoma,      the   actions
of  the   District   Judge    were    in  violation    of  their  rights   under
the   Due    Process    Clause.
   The    Supreme      Court    of  Oklahoma       denied    the writ,     585  P.
2d   351   (1978),'    holding    that   personal    jurisdiction     over   peti-
tioners    was    authorized      by   Oklahoma's       "long-arm"       statute,


  5 The   District Court's   rulings  are unreported,   and  appear   at  App.   13
and  20.
   1 Five judges  joined  in the opinion.   Two   concurred   in the result, with-
out  opinion, and  one  concurred   in part  and  dissented  in part, also without
opinion.

 court            noted             that          the         proper approach                                  was         to      test         jurisdiction
 against both                          statutory                    and          constitutional standards,                                              its      anal-

distinguishable,      functions.       It protects    the   defendant     against
the   burdens     of  litigating   in  a  distant    or  inconvenient      forum.
And    it acts to   ensure    that   the  States,   through    their   courts,   do
not   reach    out   beyond     the   limits   imposed     on   them     by  their
status   as coequal    sovereigns     in a federal system.
   The    protection     against     inconvenient      litigation    is typically
described      in  terms     of  "reasonableness"         or   "fairness."     We
have    said   that  the   defendant's     contacts    with   the   forum    State
must    be   such   that   maintenance        of  the  suit  "does    not   offend
'traditional     notions     of  fair   play    and    substantial      justice.'  "
International Shoe         Co.   v. Washington, supra, at          316,   quoting
Milliken     v. Meyer,     311   U.  S.  457, 463    (1940).      The relation-
ship   between     the  defendant      and   the  forum    must    be  such   that
it  is  "reasonable      .  . . to  require     the   corporation      to  defend
the   particular     suit   which    is  brought     there."     326    U.  S.,  at
317.     Implicit    in this  emphasis     on reasonableness       is the  under-
standing     that    the  burden     on   the   defendant,     while    always     a
primary     concern,    will  in  an   appropriate     case   be  considered     in
light   of   other   relevant     factors, including       the   forum     State's
interest     in  adjudicating       the   dispute,    see   McGee       v.  Inter-
national Life      Ins.   Co.,  355   U.   S. 220,   223   (1957);     the plain-
tiff's  interest   in  obtaining     convenient and        effective   relief,  see
Kulko     v. CaliforniaSuperior Court, supra, at              92, at  least  when
that    interest    is not    adequately      protected     by the     plaintiff's
power     to  choose    the   forum,    cf. Shaffer    v.  Heitner, 433      U.  S.
 186, 211,   n.  37   (1977);    the   interstate    judicial   system's     inter-
est  in  obtaining the      most    efficient  resolution    of  controversies;
and    the   shared    interest    of  the   several    States    in  furthering
fundamental        substantive      social   policies,   see   Kulko     v.  Cali-
fornia Superior Court, supra, at             93, 98.
   The limits     imposed     on  state   jurisdiction    by  the  Due    Process
Clause,    in  its role   as  a guarantor      against   inconvenient       litiga-
tion,   have   been    substantially     relaxed    over   the   years.    As   we
noted    in  McGee     v.  InternationalLife        Ins.   Co.,  supra, at    222-
         WORLD-WIDE         VOLKSWAGEN          CORP.    v. WOODSON           293


286                          Opinion   of the  Court
223,   this  trend   is largely  attributable     to  a fundamental       trans-
formation     in the   American     economy:
      "Today many         commercial     transactions     touch   two   or more
      States and may        involve   parties   separated    by   the  full con-
      tinent.     With     this   increasing     nationalization       of  com-
      merce    has  come    a great   increase in   the  amount of business
      conducted      by  mail   across   state   lines.   At the    same    time
      modern     transportation      and   communication        have    made    it
      much     less burdensome      for  a  party   sued to    defend himself
      in  a  State where     he  engages in     economic     activity."
 The   historical   developments noted         in  McGee, of course,        have
only   accelerated    in  the  generation     since  that case    was  decided.
   Nevertheless,      we   have   never    accepted    the  proposition     that
 state  lines  are  irrelevant   for  jurisdictional    purposes,    nor   could
 we, and remain      faithful to the principles of interstate federalism
embodied       in  the   Constitution.       The    economic     interdepend-
ence   of  the States     was   foreseen    and   desired   by   the  Framers.
In   the  Commerce       Clause,    they   provided    that   the  Nation    was
to   be  a common        market,    a   "free  trade    unit"   in   which    the
 States  are  debarred    from   acting   as  separable    economic     entities.
 H. P.    Hood    &   Sons,   Inc.   v. Du    Mond,     336   U.   S. 525,   538
 (1949).     But   the Framers       also   intended    that   the   States   re-
tain   many     essential    attributes    of  sovereignty,      including,    in
particular,    the   sovereign    power    to  try  causes in     their  courts.
The    sovereignty     of each     State,  in  turn,   implied    a  limitation
on   the   sovereignty      of  all  of  its  sister   States-a      limitation
express    or  implicit    in  both   the   original   scheme     of  the  Con-
stitution    and the   Fourteenth     Amendment.
   Hence,     even   while   abandoning the         shibboleth    that   "[t]he
 authority    of   every   tribunal    is  necessarily     restricted   by    the
 territorial   limits   of   the   State    in  which    it  is  established,"
Pennoyer v.      Neff,   supra, at    720,  we   emphasized      that  the   rea-
sonableness      of  asserting   jurisdiction    over   the  defendant     must
be   assessed   "in   the  context    of  our federal system        of  govern-

 ment,"    International Shoe         Co.   v. Washington,       326   U.   S., at
 317,   and   stressed    that   the   Due    Process    Clause ensures       not
 only    fairness,   but    also  the    "orderly    administration       of   the
 laws,"   id.,  at  319.    As   we  noted    in  Hanson v.      Denckla, 357
 U.  S.  235,  250-251     (1958):
       "As   technological progress       has   increased    the  flow   of com-
       merce    between     the  States,   the   need   for  jurisdiction    over
       nonresidents      has   undergone      a  similar   increase.      At   the
       same   time,   progress     in  communications        and    transporta-
       tion  has  made     the  defense of a     suit  in  a  foreign   tribunal
       less  burdensome.        In  response     to  these   changes,    the   re-
       quirements      for   personal     jurisdiction     over   nonresidents
       have   evolved     from    the  rigid   rule   of  Pennoyer      v.  Neff,
      95   U.   S.  714,   to  the   flexible   standard    of   International
      Shoe    Co.  v.  Washington, 326        U.  S.310.      But   it is a mis-
      take   to   assume    that   this  trend    heralds   the   eventual    de-
      mise    of  all  restrictions    on   the   personal     jurisdiction     of
      state    courts.      [Citation     omitted.]       Those     restrictions
       are  more   than    a  guarantee     of  immunity      from    inconven-
      ient   or distant   litigation.     They    are  a consequence      of ter-
      ritorial  limitations    on   the  power    of the  respective    States."
    Thus, the    Due    Process   Clause    "does   not  contemplate      that a
state   may    make    binding    a  judgment      in  personam against        an
individual     or corporate     defendant     with   which   the  state   has  no
contacts,    ties, or  relations."     International Shoe        Co.  v.  Wash-
ington, supra,       at  319.    Even    if  the   defendant     would     suffer
minimal      or  no   inconvenience       from    being    forced   to   litigate
before    the  tribunals   of  another    State;   even   if the   forum   State
has   a  strong   interest   in  applying     its law   to  the  controversy;
even    if the   forum    State   is  the  most    convenient      location   for
litigation, the    Due    Process    Clause,   acting   as  an  instrument     of
interstate    federalism,     may    sometimes     act   to  divest   the  State
of  its power to     render   a  valid  judgment.       Hanson v. Denckla,
supra, at 251,     254.

286                            Opinion   of the  Court


                                         III
   Applying       these   principles    to  the   case   at  hand,    ° we   find  in
the   record    before     us  a  total   absence     of   those   affiliating    cir-
cumstances       that    are  a  necessary     predicate to      any    exercise    of
state-court       jurisdiction.       Petitioners      carry     on   no    activity
whatsoever       in Oklahoma.         They    close   no sales   and   perform     no
services    there.     They     avail   themselves       of  none    of  the   privi-
leges   and   benefits    of  Oklahoma       law.    They     solicit no   business
there either through           salespersons     or  through      advertising rea-
 sonably calculated         to  reach    the   State.     Nor    does   the   record
 show    that   they    regularly     sell  cars   at   wholesale     or   retail   to
 Oklahoma        customers      or   residents      or   that   they     indirectly,
 through     others,   serve or     seek   to  serve   the   Oklahoma       market.
 In  short, respondents        seek   to  base   jurisdiction    on  one,   isolated
 occurrence     and    whatever      inferences    can be     drawn    therefrom:
 the   fortuitous     circumstance        that   a single     Audi     automobile,
 sold  in  New     York    to  New    York    residents,     happened      to  suffer
 an accident      while    passing    through     Oklahoma.
    It is  argued,    however,     that   because an      automobile      is mobile
 by  its  very    design   and    purpose     it was    "foreseeable"      that   the
 Robinsons'      Audi    would    cause   injury   in  Oklahoma.         Yet   "fore-
 seeability"     alone    has   never    been    a  sufficient    benchmark        for
 personal      jurisdiction      under     the    Due    Process      Clause.       In
 Hanson v. Denckla, supra, it            was no    doubt    foreseeable     that  the
 settlor    of   a  Delaware       trust    would     subsequently        move      to
 Florida    and    seek   to   exercise   a  power     of  appointment        there;
 yet   we    held   that    Florida     courts    could    not   constitutionally
    10 Respondents    argue,   as  a threshold    matter,  that   petitioners  waived
 any   objections  to  personal   jurisdiction  by   (1) joining   with  their  special
 appearances    a  challenge   to  the  District  Court's   subject-matter    jurisdic-
 tion, see  n. 4, supra, and    (2) taking  depositions   on  the merits  of  the case
 in  Oklahoma.     The   trial  court,  however,    characterized   the  appearances
 as  "special,"   and   the  Oklahoma     Supreme     Court,   rather   than   finding
 jurisdiction  waived,   reached and    decided   the statutory   and  constitutional
 questions.    Cf.  Kulko    v. California   Superior Court,     436   U.  S.  84,  91,

   This    is  not   to  say,   of  course,    that   foreseeability      is  wholly
irrelevant.       But   the   foreseeability     that   is critical   to  due   proc-
ess   analysis     is  not   the   mere    likelihood      that   a   product     will
find   its way    into the     forum    State.     Rather,     it  is that   the  de-
fendant's      conduct     and    connection      with    the   forum     State    are
such    that   he    should    reasonably       anticipate     being    haled    into
court    there.     See   Kulko     v.  California Superior Court, supra,
at  97-98;     Shaffer v.    Heitner, 433      U.   S., at  216;    and   see  id., at
217-219       (STEVENS,      J.,  concurring       in  judgment).         The    Due
Process Clause,        by  ensuring     the  "orderly     administration       of the
laws,"    InternationalShoe          Co. v.   Washington, 326        U. S.,   at 319,
gives   a  degree    of  predictability     to  the   legal  system     that  allows
potential     defendants      to   structure    their   primary      conduct with
some     minimum        assurance     as  to   where    that   conduct     will   and
 will  not   render    them    liable   to  suit.
   When      a  corporation      "purposefully       avails itself    of  the  privi-
lege of conducting        activities   within    the forum     State,"   Hanson v.
Denckla, 357       U.   S., at  253,  it  has  clear   notice   that   it is subject
to  suit there,     and   can    act  to  alleviate    the  risk  of  burdensome
litigation    by    procuring insurance,          passing    the   expected     costs
on    to customers,       or,  if  the   risks   are   too   great,   severing      its
 connection      with the     State.     Hence     if the   sale  of  a  product    of
 a  manufacturer        or  distributor     such   as  Audi    or  Volkswagen        is
 not   simply    an   isolated    occurrence,     but   arises   from    the  efforts
of   the manufacturer          or  distributor     to serve,    directly    or  indi-
 rectly,   the   market     for   its product      in  other    States,    it  is not
 unreasonable       to  subject    it to  suit   in one of     those   States   if  its
 allegedly defective        merchandise        has  there    been    the   source   of
 injury    to  its owner     or  to  others.      The    forum     State   does   not


some   of the  cases  have  treated  the  automobile   as a  "dangerous    instrumen-
tality."   But   today, under the      regime  of  International Shoe,     we  see  no
difference  for jurisdictional   purposes  between    an automobile   and any    other
chattel.   The   "dangerous    instrumentality"    concept   apparently    was  never
used   to support    personal  jurisdiction;   and  to the  extent  it has  relevance
today    it bears   not  on   jurisdiction  but   on  the   possible  desirability  of
imposing   substantive    principles  of tort  law such as   strict liability.
                          OCTOBER       TERM,    1979


                            Opinion   of the  Court                    444 U. S.


exceed   its  powers    under    the  Due    Process Clause      if  it asserts
personal    jurisdiction   over   a corporation     that delivers     its prod-
ucts  into   the  stream    of  commerce      with    the  expectation     that
they   will   be   purchased     by   consumers      in   the   forum    State.
Cf.  Gray    v.  American      Radiator &      Standard Sanitary Corp.,
22  Ill. 2d  432,   176  N.   E.  2d   761   (1961).
   But   there  is no   such   or similar   basis for   Oklahoma jurisdic-
tion  over   World-Wide       or Seaway     in  this case.    Seaway's     sales
are  made    in Massena, N. Y.          World-Wide's      market, although
substantially     larger,  is  limited   to dealers in     New    York,    New
Jersey, and Connecticut.           There   is  no  evidence    of record   that
any   automobiles     distributed     by  World-Wide       are  sold  to  retail
customers      outside   this   tristate   area.    It  is  foreseeable     that
the purchasers     of automobiles      sold by World-Wide         and Seaway
may take      them    to  Oklahoma.        But   the  mere    "unilateral    ac-
tivity  of  those who claim       some relationship      with a   nonresident
defendant     cannot satisfy      the requirement       of contact    with   the
forum    State."     Hanson v.      Denckla, supra, at       253.
   In  a  variant   on  the  previous    argument,     it is contended      that
jurisdiction    can  be  supported     by the   fact  that petitioners     earn
substantial    revenue from      goods used in     Oklahoma.        The Okla-
homa    Supreme      Court so   found,    585  P.  2d, at 354-355,     drawing
the   inference   that   because    one  automobile      sold  by petitioners
had    been   used    in  Oklahoma,      others    might    have    been   used
there   also.    While    this  inference    seems    less  than   compelling
on   the   facts  of  the   instant    case,  we   need    not   question    the
court's   factual   findings   in  order to    reject its reasoning.
   This argument        seems    to make     the  point   that  the   purchase
of  automobiles      in New    York,    from   which   the   petitioners    earn
substantial     revenue,    would   not occur     but for the    fact  that  the
automobiles      are  capable of    use in distant    States  like Oklahoma.
Respondents       observe    that  the   very   purpose    of an   automobile
is to  travel,  and   that   travel  of  automobiles     sold  by  petitioners
is  facilitated    by   an   extensive    chain    of  Volkswagen        service
 centers    throughout      the   country,     including     some     in  Okla-

would    be   any   actual    inconvenience       to  the defendant.         The
essential   inquiry    in locating    the  constitutional     limits   on  state-
court   jurisdiction    over   absent defendants        is  whether    the   par-
ticular   exercise   of  jurisdiction    offends   " 'traditional    notions    of
fair play   and substantial      justice.'  "   InternationalShoe, supra,

The   clear  focus   in InternationalShoe         was   on  fairness   and   rea-
sonableness.       Kulko    v.  California Superior Court,           436   U.   S.
84, 92   (1978).      The   Court    specifically   declined    to  establish    a

State   and   the  defendant:
      "Whether       due   process    is  satisfied    must    depend     rather
      upon    the  quality   and   nature    of the  activity    in relation to
      the  fair and orderly       administration of        the  laws   which    it
      was    the   purpose     of  the   due    process    clause    to  insure.
      That    clause   does   not  contemplate      that  a  state  may    make
      binding    a  judgment     in  personam against        an  individual     or
      corporate    defendant     with   which    the  state  has  no   contacts,
      ties, or  relations."      326   U.  S.,  at 319    (emphasis     added).
The   existence     of  contacts,    so  long   as   there   were some,      was
merely     one   way    of  giving    content    to  the   determination        of
fairness and     reasonableness.
   Surely    International Shoe         contemplated        that   the   signifi-
cance   of  the   contacts   necessary     to  support    jurisdiction    would
diminish     if  some    other    consideration      helped    establish    that
jurisdiction    would     be  fair  and    reasonable.      The    interests    of
the  State    and   other   parties   in  proceeding      with   the  case   in  a
particular    forum     are   such   considerations.        McGee     v.  Inter-
national Life     Ins.  Co.,  355   U.  S. 220,   223 (1957),     for  instance,
accorded     great importance        to  a  State's   "manifest     interest    in
providing     effective    means     of  redress"     for  its  citizens.     See

v.  Heitner, 433      U.   S.  186,   208   (1977);     Mullane     v.  Central
Hanover Trust        Co.,  339  U.  S.  306,  313   (1950).

     In      each        of     these         cases,         I    would           find       that        the      forum            State

able.           Accordingly,                   I   would           hold        that       it    is   neither            unfair          nor
unreasonable                     to      require            these         defendants                  to      defend            in      the

 ward    in   Minnesota,       the   defendant      would     bear    almost     no
 burden     or expense      beyond     what     he   would    face   if  the   suit
 were   in  his  home    State.     The    real  impact     on  the   named     de-
 fendant    is the   same    as  it is in  a  direct   action   against    the  in-
 surer,  which     would    be   constitutionally      permissible.       Watson

 The   only   distinction    is the  formal,    "analytica[l]     prerequisite,"
 post,  at  331,   of  making     the   insured    a  named     party.      Surely
 the  mere    addition    of  appellant's     name    to  the  complaint      does
 not suffice   to create   a due process violation.'
    Finally,   even    were   the relevant inquiry          whether there       are
 sufficient   contacts    between     the  forum and      the   named     defend-
 ant,   I  would     find   that   such    contacts     exist.   The     insurer's
 presence    in  Minnesota      is  an  advantage      to the   defendant      that
 may   well   have   been   a  consideration     in his   selecting   the   policy
 he   did.   An    insurer    with    offices   in  many States         makes     it
 easier for    the  insured    to  make     claims   or  conduct     other   busi-
 ness  that   may     become     necessary     while   traveling.      It  is sim-
 ply  not   true    that   "State Farm's        decision    to  do   business    in
Minnesota       was    completely      adventitious      as  far  as  Rush     was
concerned."        Post,    at  328-329.       By    buying     a   State   Farm
 policy,  the   defendant     availed    himself   of  the  benefits    he might
 derive    from   having     an   insurance      agent    in  Minnesota       who
could,    among      other    things,    facilitate    a  suit   for   appellant
against    a  Minnesota resident.          It  seems    unreasonable      to  read
 the Constitution       as  permitting      one   to  take   advantage      of  his
nationwide      insurance     network      but  not   to  be   burdened     by   it.
   In   sum,   I  would    hold   that  appellant     is not   deprived    of  due
process    by   being    required     to  submit     to  trial   in  Minnesota,
first  because     Minnesota has        a sufficient    interest    in  and   con-

 underlying                the      litigation             occurred             in     Oklahoma.                   The        plain-
 tiffs      were        hospitalized                 in     Oklahoma                when          they        brought             suit.
 Essential              witnesses               and         evidence              were          in     Oklahoma.                    See
 Shaffer           v.   Heitner, 433                  U.     S.,     at    208.          The       State        has       a legiti-
 mate         interest           in     enforcing             its    laws designed                    to    keep         its    high-
 way         system           safe,        and        the      trial       can       proceed            at     least        as     effi-
 ciently          in    Oklahoma                as    anywhere               else.
      The        petitioners               are      not       unconnected with                         the       forum.             Al-
 though            both        sell      automobiles                  within          limited           sales        territories,
 each         sold       the      automobile                 which          in     fact       was       driven           to     Okla-
 homa          where          it   was       involved             in    an     accident.'                It    may         be     true,
 as     the      Court           suggests,             that       each         sincerely            intended              to     limit
 its    commercial                 impact            to    the       limited          territory,             and      that        each
 intended              to     accept           the       benefits            and        protection               of     the       laws
 only       of    those         States         within         the territory.                    But obviously                    these
 were        unrealistic              hopes          that      cannot           be     treated          as    an     automatic
 constitutional                   shield.'


     8 On     the     basis      of    this     fact    the     state      court       inferred        that     the     petitioners
derived         substantial           revenue         from      goods       used in        Oklahoma.              The      inference
is    not      without          support.            Certainly,           were       use      of    goods        accepted          as     a
 relevant         contact,        a plaintiff         would       not     need      to   have       an exact         count       of   the
 number          of   petitioners'           cars     that     are    used       in Oklahoma.
     9 Moreover,            imposing           liability      in    this    case      would tonot  business. so undermine            cer-
 tainty       as   to   destroy an           automobile dealer's                  ability           do                       Accord-
ing     jurisdiction          does      not    expand         liability      except       in the       marginal         case     where
 a   plaintiff        cannot        afford       to    bring      an action           except       in    the     plaintiff's        own
 State.        In     addition,         these       petitioners          are     represented            by     insurance          com-
panies.          They       not     only      could,      but     did,    purchase insurance                  to protect them
 should       they stand trial                and      lose    the     case.       The       costs     of   the     insurance          no
doubt are            passed       on    to    customers.

  An    automobile      simply     is not   a  stationary     item   or   one de-
signed    to  be  used    in  one   place.     An   automobile       is intended
to be  moved     around.      Someone in       the  business    of selling   large
numbers      of  automobiles      can   hardly     plead   ignorance      of  their
mobility    or  pretend     that   the  automobiles       stay   put  after   they
are  sold.    It  is  not  merely     that   a dealer    in  automobiles      fore-
sees  that   they   will  move.      Ante,   at  295.    The    dealer   actually
intends    that   the  purchasers     will use   the   automobiles      to  travel
to  distant   States    where    the  dealer   does   not   directly   "do   busi-
ness."    The     sale  of   an  automobile       does    purposefully      inject
the  vehicle    into the stream       of  interstate    commerce       so  that   it
can   travel   to   distant   States.      See   Kulko,    436   U.   S.,  at  94;
Hanson v.      Denckla, 357       U.  S.  235,   253   (1958).
   This   case   is similar   to  Ohio v.    Wyandotte       ChemicalsCorp.,
401   U.   S. 493    (1971).     There     we   indicated,    in  the   course    of
denying     leave   to  file an   original-jurisdiction       case,  that   corpo-
rations    having     no   direct   contact     with   Ohio     could   constitu-
tionally   be   brought    to  trial  in  Ohio because      they   dumped      pol-
lutants    into   streams     outside    Ohio's    limits   which     ultimately,
through     the   action    of  the   water,   reached     Lake    Erie   and    af-
fected    Ohio.      No    corporate     acts,    only    their   consequences,
occurred     in Ohio.      The   stream    of  commerce       is just as   natural
a  force as    a  stream    of  water,    and    it was   equally     predictable
that     the    cars    petitioners      released     would      reach     distant
States."o
   The    Court     accepts    that   a  State    may    exercise    jurisdiction
over    a  distributor    which     "serves"    that   State    "indirectly"     by
"deliver[ing]       its products into       the  stream     of  commerce       with
the   expectation      that   they   will  be  purchased by        consumers      in
the   forum    State."     Ante,   at  297-298.      It  is difficult  to see  why
the Constitution        should    distinguish     between      a case   involving


   10 One  might   argue   that  it was  more    predictable  that  the   pollutants
would   reach  Ohio than   that one of  petitioners' cars  would  reach  Oklahoma.
The   Court's  analysis,  however,  excludes   jurisdiction in  a contiguous   State
such as  Pennsylvania    as surely as in more distant   States  such as Oklahoma.

 dictional     principle.      But     that    principle,     with    its   almost
 exclusive    focus   on   the rights    of  defendants, may        be  outdated.

    International       Shoe     inherited     its   defendant       focus    from
 Pennoyer v.       Neff,   95  U.   S.  714   (1878),    and represented        the
 last  major     step   this  Court    has   taken    in  the   long   process    of
 liberalizing    the  doctrine    of  personal    jurisdiction.       Though     its
 flexible   approach     represented      a  major    advance,     the  structure
 of  our   society    has   changed      in  many     significant     ways    since
 InternationalShoe          was   decided    in  1945.     Mr.   Justice    Black,
 writing    for  the  Court    in McGee      v. InternationalLife        Ins. Co.,
 355   U.  S.  220,  222   (1957),    recognized     that   "a  trend   is clearly
 discernible     toward expanding          the   permissible     scope    of  state
 jurisdiction    over   foreign   corporations     and   other   nonresidents."
 He explained       the trend    as  follows:
       "In   part   this   is attributable      to  the   fundamental       trans-
       formation     of our   national    economy over      the  years.     Today
       many     commercial      transactions     touch    two or    more    States
       and   may    involve    parties   separated     by  the   full  continent.
       With     this   increasing     nationalization       of   commerce      has
       come    a great  increase    in the  amount      of business conducted
       by mail      across   state   lines.    At the     same    time    modern
       transportation       and   communication         have made        it  much
       less  burdensome       for  a  party   sued    to  defend    himself    in  a
       State   where     he   engages     in  economic     activity."      Id.,  at
       222-223.
As   the  Court    acknowledges,      ante, at    292-293,    both   the  nation-
 alization   of commerce       and  the   ease  of  transportation      and  com-
munication       have    accelerated     in  the   generation      since   1957.13

 The    model     of  society    on   which     the   International Shoe          Court
 based    its  opinion     is  no   longer    accurate.       Business     people,     no
 matter     how     local  their    businesses,     cannot     assume      that    goods
 remain     in  the  business'     locality.      Customers and         goods    can   be
 anywhere       else  in  the   country     usually    in  a  matter    of hours     and
 always     in  a matter     of  a very    few    days.
    In   answering        the   question      whether      or   not    it  is fair   and
 reasonable      to  allow a     particular     forum     to  hold    a trial   binding
 on   a particular     defendant,      the interests      of the   forum     State   and
 other     parties     loom     large    in   today's     world     and    surely     are
 entitled    to  as  much     weight     as  are   the   interests    of  the   defend-
 ant.     The     "orderly     administration         of   the   laws"     provides      a
 firm    basis   for   according      some     protection      to   the   interests     of
 plaintiffs and       States    as  well   as of    defendants.14        Certainly,      I
 cannot     see   how a     defendant's      right    to  due   process     is violated
 if the   defendant      suffers no     inconvenience.          See   ante, at 294.
    The     conclusion       I  draw     is  that    constitutional       concepts      of
 fairness    no   longer    require    the   extreme      concern     for  defendants
 that    was   once    necessary.       Rather,     as   I  wrote    in  dissent    from

   '  The Court     has  recognized    that  there  are  cases  where   the interests   of
justice   can  turn   the   focus   of the   jurisdictional   inquiry   away    from   the
 contacts   between    a  defendant     and  the   forum    State.   For   instance,   the
 Court   indicated   that  the  requirement     of contacts   may    be greatly   relaxed
 (if indeed   any personal     contacts   would    be required)    where   a  plaintiff  is
suing   a  nonresident   defendant    to  enforce  a  judgment    procured    in another

has contacts           with      the    State      "such      that     he    should      reasonably
 anticipate         being       haled       into     court      there."      11    Ante,       at    297.
 There      is nothing        unreasonable           or unfair,       however,         about      recog-
 nizing      commercial            reality.        Given        the     tremendous            mobility
 of   goods       and      people,        and     the     inability        of    businessmen            to
 control       where       goods       are    taken       by     customers          (or    retailers),
 I   do    not     think       that     the     defendant           should       be    in    complete
 control      of   the     geographical          stretch       of   his   amenability           to   suit.
 Jurisdiction          is   no    longer       premised         on    the     notion       that      non-
 resident        defendants           have       somehow           impliedly          consented          to
 suit.      People       should       understand           that     they     are    held     responsi-
 ble     for    the     consequences            of    their      actions       and      that     in    our
 society      most      actions      have      consequences affecting                 many       States.
 When an           action       in   fact     causes       injury      in   another        State,      the
 actor     should be          prepared        to   aswer       for   it  there      unless     defend-
 ing    in   that     State     would       be   unfair      for    some      reason      other      than
 that     a  state     boundary          must      be   crossed.19
     In   effect     the Court         is  allowing        defendants          to   assert     the    sov-


 and    be   heard."      Mullane       v.  Central Hanover            Trust    Co.,   339    U.   S.  306,
 313 18 The Court (1950).suggests    that    this  is  the   critical foreseeability        rather than
 the   likelihood    that the product         will  go  to the    forum    State.     But    the   reason-
 ing   begs    the   question.      A   defendant       cannot     know     if  his  actions    will   sub-
 ject   him   to   jurisdiction     in   another State        until   we   have    declared     what    the
 law    of jurisdiction      is.
     -One      consideration       that   might     create    some    unfairness      would     be   if the
 choice    of  forum     also   imposed      on the defendant         an   unfavorable       substantive
 law which       the   defendant      could justly have         assumed      would    not apply.        See
 n.  15,  supra.

ereign   rights   of   their home      States.     The    expressed     fear  is that
otherwise     all  limits   on   personal     jurisdiction     would     disappear.
But    the   argument's       premise     is  wrong.      I  would     not   abolish
limits   on   jurisdiction      or  strip   state   boundaries       of  all  signifi-
cance,    see   Hanson, supra,         at   260    (Black,    J.,  dissenting);       I
would     still require    the   plaintiff to    demonstrate        sufficient   con-
tacts   among     the parties,     the  forum, and       the  litigation    to make
the   forum     a reasonable      State   in  which     to  hold   the  trial."
    I would     also,  however,     strip   the  defendant      of  an  unjustified
veto    power     over   certain very       appropriate      fora-a      power     the
defendant       justifiably    enjoyed      long   ago   when     communication
and    travel   over    long    distances     were    slow    and   unpredictable
and    when     notions    of   state   sovereignty      were    impractical      and
exaggerated.         But   I repeat    that that     is not today's      world.      If
a plaintiff     can   show    that    his  chosen    forum     State    has   a  suffi-
cient   interest    in  the litigation      (or  sufficient    contacts    with    the
defendant),       then the      defendant      who     cannot    show     some    real
injury    to a   constitutionally      protected     interest,    see  O'Connor v.
Lee-Hy      Paving Corp.,        579   F.  2d,  at  201,   should    have    no   con-
stitutional     excuse    not   to  appear.2
    The   plaintiffs    in each of     these   cases   brought     suit  in  a forum
with   which     they   had   significant    contacts and      which    had signifi-
cant    contacts     with    the litigation.       I  am    not    convinced      that
the   defendants       would    suffer   any "heavy       and    disproportionate
burden"      in   defending      the   suits.    Accordingly,       I   would     hold


   20 For  instance, in  No. 78-952,   if the  plaintiff were  not  a  bona  fide resi-
dent  of  Minnesota    when   the suit was  filed or if the  defendant   were  subject
to financial  liability, I might  well reach  a  different result.   In No.  78-1078,
I  might   reach   a   different  result  if the   accident   had   not   occurred   in
Oklahoma.
   21 Frequently,   of  course,   the  defendant    will  be  able  to  influence   the
choice of   forum   through   traditional  doctrines,  such  as venue   or forum non
convenien8,   permitting    the  transfer  of  litigation.  Shaffer   v. Heitner, 433

   MR.    JUSTICE    MARSHALL,        with   whom     MR.    JUSTICE     BLACK-
MUN     joins,  dissenting.
   For   over  30  years   the standard     by  which    to measure     the con-
stitutionally     permissible     reach   of  state-court     jurisdiction has
been    well  established:
      "[D]ue     process    requires    only   that   in  order   to  subject    a
      defendant     to  a judgment      in personam, if he      be  not present
      within    the   territory   of  the  forum,    he  have    certain   mini-
      mum contacts        with    it such   that   the  maintenance       of  the
      suit  does   not   offend   'traditional    notions    of  fair play   and
      substantial     justice.'"     International Shoe         Co.   v. Wash-
      ington,    326   U.   S.  310,   316   (1945),    quoting    Milliken     v.
      Meyer,     311  U.  S. 457, 463     (1940).
The    corollary,   that   the  Due    Process Clause       forbids   the  asser-
tion  of  jurisdiction    over  a  defendant     "with   which    the  state  has
no   contacts,    ties,  or  relations,"    326   U.  S.,  at  319,  is  equally
clear.    The    concepts     of   fairness    and   substantial     justice    as
applied     to  an  evaluation      of  "the   quality    and   nature    of  the
 [defendant's]      activity,"    ibid.,  are  not    readily   susceptible     of
further    definition, however,        and   it is  not  surprising     that  the
constitutional standard         is easier   to  state  than   to  apply.
   This    is  a  difficult  case,   and    reasonable     minds    may    differ
as  to  whether     respondents      have   alleged   a  sufficient   "relation-
ship among       the  defendant[s],       the  forum,    and   the  litigation,"
Shaffer    v. Heitner, 433       U.  S.  186,  204    (1977),   to   satisfy  the
requirements       of  International Shoe.          I  am    concerned,     how-
ever,   that   the majority       has   reached    its  result   by taking     an
unnecessarily narrow          view   of  petitioners'    forum-related       con-
duct.     The    majority     asserts   that   "respondents      seek    to  base
jurisdiction     on   one,   isolated   occurrence     and    whatever     infer-
ences    can   be  drawn     therefrom:      the   fortuitous    circumstance
that   a single   Audi automobile,       sold  in New     York   to  New    York

 residents,   happened      to suffer an   accident    while  passing    through
 Oklahoma."        Ante,    at   295.    If  that   were   the   case,   I would
 readily   agree   that   the  minimum contacts          necessary    to  sustain
 jurisdiction    are   not  present.      But   the   basis for   the   assertion
 of jurisdiction    is not   the  happenstance       that  an  individual     over
 whom     petitioners    had   no control    made    a unilateral    decision    to
take   a  chattel   with    him   to  a distant   State.     Rather,     jurisdic-
 tion  is  premised     on  the   deliberate    and    purposeful     actions    of
 the   defendants      themselves     in  choosing     to  become      part   of *a
 nationwide,     indeed    a global,   network     for  marketing      and   serv-
icing   automobiles.
    Petitioners     are  sellers   of  a   product    whose     utility   derives
 from   its mobility.      The    unique    importance      of the   automobile
in  today's    society,   which    is discussed     in MR.    JUSTICE     BLACK-
 MUN'S     dissenting     opinion,     post,   at   318,   needs     no   further
elaboration.       Petitioners     know    that   their   customers     buy   cars
 not   only   to   make    short    trips,  but   also   to   travel   long    dis-
tances.      In  fact,  the   nationwide      service   network     with    which
 they   are   affiliated   was   designed     to  facilitate    and   encourage
such    travel.    Seaway      would    be  unlikely    to  sell  many     cars  if
 authorized     service    were    available     only    in  Massena,      N.   Y.
Moreover,      local   dealers   normally     derive   a  substantial     portion
 of  their  revenues      from   their   service    operations     and   thereby
obtain    a   further    economic     benefit    from    the   opportunity       to
service    cars  which    were    sold in   other   States.     It  is apparent
that   petitioners     have   not   attempted      to  minimize      the  chance
that   their   activities   will  have    effects   in other    States;   on   the
contrary,     they   have    chosen    to  do  business    in  a  way    that  in-
creases    that  chance,    because    it is to  their   economic     advantage
to   do  so.
    To   be  sure,  petitioners    could   not  know     in advance     that   this
 particular    automobile      would be      driven    to  Oklahoma.        They
 must    have    anticipated,     however,     that   a   substantial     portion
 of the   cars  they   sold  would    travel   out  of New York.         Seaway,

Wide,     one   of  only    seven   regional     Audi    distributors     in  the
entire   country,    see   Brief   for  Respondents        2,  would    scarcely
have   been   surprised    to  learn  that   a car  sold  by them     had   been
driven   in  Oklahoma      on  Interstate    44,  a heavily    traveled   trans-
continental     highway.       In  the   case of   the distributor,      in  par-
ticular, the    probability     that   some    of  the  cars   it sells  will  be
driven    in every   one of    the  contiguous     States    must amount       to
a virtual   certainty.      This   knowledge     should    alert  a reasonable
businessman       to  the   likelihood     that   a  defect   in  the   product
might manifest       itself in  the  forum    State-not      because    of some
unpredictable,      aberrant,     unilateral    action   by   a  single   buyer,
but   in  the  normal    course    of  the  operation     of the   vehicles   for
their   intended    purpose.
   It is  misleading     for   the  majority     to  characterize     the  argu-
ment in    favor   of jurisdiction    as  one  of  " 'foreseeability'    alone."
Ante,   at 295.     As  economic     entities   petitioners    reach   out  from
New     York,    knowingly       causing    effects   in   other    States   and
receiving    economic     advantage      both   from    the  ability   to  cause
such effects    themselves      and   from   the   activities  of  dealers   and
distributors     in   other    States.     While     they   did    not   receive
revenue     from    making direct       sales  in  Oklahoma,       they   inten-
tionally became       part of   an  interstate   economic     network,    which
included     dealerships     in   Oklahoma,      for   pecuniary      gain.    In
light   of  this  purposeful      conduct     I do   not   believe    it can   be
said   that   petitioners     "had   no   reason    to  expect    to  be   haled
before   a[n   Oklahoma]        court."     Shaffer   v.  Heitner, supra, at
216;   see ante, at    297,  and   Kulko    v.  CaliforniaSuperior Court,
436   U.  S.  84,  97-98    (1978).
   The   majority     apparently      acknowledges      that   if a  product    is
purchased     in  the  forum     State   by  a  consumer,     that   State may
assert jurisdiction      over   everyone     in the   chain   of  distribution.
See  ante, at    297-298.     With    this  I  agree.    But   I cannot    agree
that  jurisdiction    is necessarily    lacking if the product enters         the
State   not    through     the   channels     of  distribution     but    in  the
course of    its intended     use  by   the  consumer.       We    have   recog-

our      notions          of    personal           jurisdiction.                 See      Shaffer         v.    Heitner,
supra, at           204;        Hess       v.    Pawloski, 274                 U.     S.    352      (1927).             Un-
like      most       other       chattels,          which         may       find      their      way       into      States
far     from       where         they      were       purchased             because           their owner             takes
them there,               the     intended            use     of    the     automobile              is   precisely           as
a    means          of    traveling            from        one      place        to    another.              In     such       a
case,        it     is    highly          artificial theto chain restrict distribution the       concept           of      the
"stream            of    commerce"                to                          of                              from         the


manufacturer                  to    the     ultimate           consumer.
     I   sympathize              with       the     majority's            concern          that      persons         ought
to     be    able       to    structure their                  conduct           so    as    not      to    be     subject
to     suit     in    distant          forums.             But       that      may        not      always         be    pos-
 sible.         Some          activities           by      their        very        nature          may        foreclose
 the      option          of     conducting              them         in     such        a    way        as    to     avoid
 subjecting            oneself         to    jurisdiction             in    multiple           forums.             This       is
by      no     means to             say     that       all    sellers        of    automobiles               should         be
 subject         to     suit     everywhere;                 but      a   distributor             of     automobiles
 to     a    multistate             market           and       a    local       automobile                dealer         who
 makes         himself part              of    a   nationwide              network           of dealerships               can
 fairly       expect         that       the     cars      they       sell     may       cause        injury         in    dis-
 tant      States        and      that      they       may       be     called       on    to    defend         a   result-
 ing      lawsuit          there.

the      majority's            reliance          on    Kulko          v.   CaliforniaSuperior Court,

with        an    action         to   modify his
obligations.                 His      only      contact          with       the      forum         State       was       that
he      gave        his      minor          child        permission              to     live      there        with        her
mother.              In     holding          that       the     exercise          of   jurisdiction              violated

contrasting      Kulko's    actions    with   those    of  the  insurance     com-
pany     in McGee      v.  International Life        Ins.  Co.,   355   U.  S.  220
 (1957),    which    were    undertaken      for   commercial      benefit.*
   Manifestly,      the "quality     and   nature"     of commercial      activity
is  different,   for  purposes     of  the  International Shoe         test,  from
actions    from    which    a  defendant      obtains    no   economic     advan-
 tage.    Commercial        activity   is  more    likely   to  cause   effects   in
 a larger   sphere,   and   the  actor derives     an  economic     benefit   from
 the  activity   that   makes    it fair  to require    him   to  answer    for  his
 conduct    where    its effects   are  felt.   The    profits  may    be used    to
 pay the     costs  of  suit,  and   knowing      that   the  activity    is likely
 to have effects     in  other States the      defendant     can  readily    insure
 against the    costs   of those   effects,  thereby    sparing    himself much
 of  the  inconvenience       of  defending      in  a  distant    forum.
    Of  course,    the Constitution       forbids    the  exercise    of  jurisdic-
 tion  if the  defendant     had   no  judicially   cognizable     contacts    with
 the  forum.      But    as  the majority       acknowledges,       if  such   con-
 tacts  are   present    the  jurisdictional inquiry        requires    a  balanc-
ing  of various     interests   and   policies.     See  ante, at 292;    Rush v.
Savchuk,      post, at   332.    I believe    such   contacts   are  to be   found
 here   and   that,   considering     all  of the   interests    and   policies   at
 stake,  requiring     petitioners    to  defend    this  action   in  Oklahoma
is  not   beyond     the  bounds      of  the  Constitution.        Accordingly,
I  dissent.


   MR.    JUSTICE    BLACKMUN,        dissenting.
   I   confess   that    I  am   somewhat       puzzled     why    the   plaintiffs
in  this   litigation   are  so  insistent    that   the  regional    distributor
and    the   retail  dealer,    the  petitioners     here,   who    handled     the
ill-fated   Audi    automobile      involved    in  this litigation,    be  named
defendants.        It  would    appear    that   the manufacturer         and   the


   *Similarly,  I  believe the  Court   in  Hanson v.    Denckla,   357  U. S.   235
 (1958), was   influenced  by  the fact that trust  administration   has  tradition-
ally been   considered  a peculiarly  local  activity.

importer,    whose    subjectability     to Oklahoma       jurisdiction    is not
challenged     before   this  Court,   ought    not  to  be  judgment-proof.
 It may,    of   course,   ultimately     amount     to a contest       between
insurance     companies      that,   once   begun,    is  not  easily   brought
 to a  termination.       Having     made    this much     of an  observation,
I  pursue   it no   further.
   For   me,   a  critical factor    in  the  disposition    of  the  litigation
is  the  nature    of  the  instrumentality       under    consideration.       It
has   been said     that  we   are  a  nation   on   wheels.     What     we  are
 concerned     with    here   is  the   automobile       and   its  peripatetic
 character.      One   need    only   examine     our   national    network     of
 interstate   highways,      or  make    an  appearance      on   one  of  them,
 or  observe    the  variety    of license    plates   present    not   only   on
 those highways       but   in  any   metropolitan      area,   to realize   that
 any   automobile     is likely   to wander     far  from   its place   of licen-
 sure  or from its   place of    distribution   and   retail  sale.   Miles per
 gallon   on   the  highway      (as   well  as  in  the   city)   and   mileage
 per   tankful    are    familiar    allegations     in  manufacturers'        ad-
 vertisements today.         To expect      that  any   new   automobile      will
 remain    in  the  vicinity   of  its retail  sale-like     the   1914   electric
 car  driven    by  the   proverbial     "little  old  lady"-is     to  blink   at
 reality.    The    automobile      is intended     for  distance    as   well  as
 for transportation      within a limited area.
    It  therefore    seems    to  me   not   unreasonable-and          certainly
 not unconstitutional         and beyond       the  reach    of  the  principles
 laid  down in     InternationalShoe         Co.  v.  Washington, 326        U. S.
 310   (1945),   and   its progeny-to       uphold    Oklahoma      jurisdiction
 over    this  New     York    distributor    and    this  New     York    dealer
 when    the accident happened         in Oklahoma.        I see  nothing more
 unfair   for  them    than    for  the  manufacturer       and   the  importer.
 All  are   in  the  business    of  providing     vehicles   that   spread    out
 over   the  highways      of  our  several    States.    It  is not   too  much
 to  anticipate     at  the  time    of  distribution     and   at  the   time   of
 retail  sale  that   this  Audi    would    be  in  Oklahoma.        Moreover,
 in  assessing    "minimum        contacts,"    foreseeable     use  in  another
 State   seems    to me   to  be  little different from      foreseeable    resale

in   another     State.    Yet    the   Court    declares     this  distinction
determinative.        Ante,   at  297-299.
   MR. JUSTICE      BRENNAN       points   out  in his dissent, ante, at     307,
that   an   automobile      dealer    derives    substantial    benefits    from
States other      than   its own.     The    same    is true  of  the   regional
distributor.      Oklahoma       does   its  best   to  provide     safe   roads.
Its  police   investigate     accidents.      It  regulates    driving    within
the   State.     It provides     aid   to  the  victim    and    thereby,    it is
hoped,    lessens    damages.      Accident     reports    are   prepared     and
made     available.      All  this   contributes      to  and    enhances     the
business     of  those   engaged      professionally     in  the distribution
and   sale  of  automobiles.       All  this  also  may    benefit  defendants
in  the  very   lawsuits    over which      the  State   asserts   jurisdiction.
   My    position    need   not   now   take   me   beyond    the   automobile
and   the   professional    who does     business    by way     of distributing
and    retailing    automobiles.        Cases    concerning      other    instru-
mentalities     will  be  dealt   with   as  they    arise  and   in  their  own
contexts.
    I would    affirm  the   judgment     of  the  Supreme     Court    of  Okla-
homa.       Because     the   Court     reverses    that   judgment,      it  will
now be      about    parsing    every   variant    in  the  myriad     of  motor
vehicle     fact  situations     that   present    themselves.       Some     will
justify    jurisdiction    and others      will  not.    All  will   depend     on
the   "contact"     that    the  Court    sees   fit to  perceive    in   the  in-
 dividual    case.

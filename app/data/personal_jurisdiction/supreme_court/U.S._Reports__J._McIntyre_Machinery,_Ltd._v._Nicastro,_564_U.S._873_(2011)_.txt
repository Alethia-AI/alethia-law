     certiorari to           the    supreme court of                new     jersey


      No. 09–1343.       Argued January 11, 2011—Decided June 27, 2011


Respondent Nicastro injured his hand while using a metal-shearing ma
   chine that petitioner J. McIntyre Machinery, Ltd. (J. McIntyre), manu
   factured in England, where the company is incorporated and operates.
   Nicastro  led this products-liability suit in a state court in New Jersey,
   where the accident occurred, but J. McIntyre sought to dismiss the suit
   for want of personal jurisdiction.           Nicastro’s jurisdictional claim was
   based on three primary facts: A U. S. distributor agreed to sell J. McIn
   tyre’s machines in this country; J. McIntyre of cials attended trade
   shows in several States, albeit not in New Jersey; and no more than
   four J. McIntyre machines (the record suggests only one), including the
   one at issue, ended up in New Jersey.             The State Supreme Court held
   that New Jersey’s courts can exercise jurisdiction over a foreign manu
   facturer without contravening the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Proc
   ess Clause so long as the manufacturer knew or reasonably should have
   known that its products are distributed through a nationwide distribu
   tion system that might lead to sales in any of the States.               Invoking this
   “stream-of-commerce” doctrine of jurisdiction, the court relied in part
   on Asahi Metal Industry Co. v. Superior Court of Cal., Solano Cty., 480
   U. S. 102.    Applying its test, the court concluded that J. McIntyre was
   subject to jurisdiction in New Jersey, even though at no time had it
   advertised in, sent goods to, or in any relevant sense targeted the State.
Held:   The judgment is reversed.
201 N. J. 48, 987 A. 2d 575, reversed.
      Justice Kennedy,         joined by The      Chief Justice, Justice           Scalia,
   and   Justice    Thomas,      concluded that because J. McIntyre never en
   gaged in any activities in New Jersey that revealed an intent to invoke
   or bene t from the protection of the State’s laws, New Jersey is without
   power to adjudge the company’s rights and liabilities, and its exercise
   of jurisdiction would violate due process.            Pp. 879–887.
      (a) Due process protects the defendant’s right not to be coerced ex
   cept by lawful judicial power.         A court may subject a defendant to judg
   ment only when the defendant has suf cient contacts with the sovereign
   “such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend ‘traditional no

   tions of fair play and substantial justice.’ ”             International Shoe        Co.  v.
   Washington, 326 U. S. 310, 316.           Freeform fundamental fairness notions
   divorced from traditional practice cannot transform a judgment ren
   dered without authority into law.              As a general rule, the sovereign’s
   exercise of power requires some act by which the defendant “purpose
   fully  avails    itself  of   the   privilege     of  conducting      activities    within
   the forum State, thus invoking the bene ts and protections of its laws.”
   Hanson     v.  Denckla,      357   U. S.   235,  253.    In   cases   like   this   one,  it
   is the defendant’s purposeful availment that makes jurisdiction con
   sistent with “fair play and substantial justice” notions.                   No “stream
   of-commerce”       doctrine    can   displace    that   general     rule   for  products-
   liability cases.
      The rules and standards for determining state jurisdiction over an
   absent party have been unclear because of decades-old questions left
   open in Asahi.       The imprecision arising from Asahi, for the most part,
   results from its statement of the relation between jurisdiction and the
   “stream of commerce.”           That concept, like other metaphors, has its de
    ciencies as well as its utilities.          It refers to the movement of goods
   from manufacturers through distributors to consumers, yet beyond that
   descriptive purpose its meaning is far from exact.                A defendant’s place
   ment of goods into commerce “with the expectation that they will be
   purchased by consumers in the forum State” may indicate purpose
   ful availment.       World-Wide       Volkswagen      Corp.    v.  Woodson,     444 U. S.
   286, 298.    But that does not amend the general rule of personal jurisdic
   tion.   The principal inquiry in cases of this sort is whether the defend
   ant’s activities manifest an intention to submit to the power of a sover
   eign.    See,  e. g., Hanson,     supra,    at 253.    In   Asahi,   Justice Brennan’s
   concurrence ( joined by three other Justices) discarded the central con
   cept of sovereign authority in favor of fairness and foreseeability consid
   erations on the theory that the defendant’s ability to anticipate suit is
   the touchstone of jurisdiction.            480 U. S., at 117.        However, Justice
   O’Connor’s lead opinion (also for four Justices) stated that “[t]he ‘sub
   stantial connection’ between the defendant and the forum State neces
   sary for a  nding of minimum contacts must come about by an action of
   the defendant purposefully directed toward the forum State.”                        Id.,  at
   112.   Since    Asahi,   the courts have sought to reconcile the competing
   opinions.     But Justice Brennan’s rule based on general notions of fair
   ness and foreseeability is inconsistent with the premises of lawful ju
   dicial power under this Court’s precedents.                  Today’s conclusion that
   the authority to subject a defendant to judgment depends on purpose
   ful  availment     is  consistent     with    Justice    O’Connor’s      Asahi    opinion.

   (b)  Nicastro has not established that J. McIntyre engaged in conduct
purposefully directed at New Jersey.                 The company had no of ce in
New Jersey; it neither paid taxes nor owned property there; and it nei
ther advertised in, nor sent any employees to, the State.                     Indeed, the
trial court found that petitioner did not have a single contact with the
State apart from the fact that the machine in question ended up there.
Neither these facts, nor the three on which Nicastro centered his juris
dictional claim, show that J. McIntyre purposefully availed itself of the
New Jersey market.           Pp. 885–887.
   Justice Breyer, joined by Justice Alito, agreed that the New Jer
sey Supreme Court’s judgment must be reversed, but concluded that
because this case does not present issues arising from recent changes in
commerce and communication, it is unwise to announce a rule of broad
applicability without fully considering modern-day consequences.
Rather, the outcome of the case is determined by the Court’s prece
dents.    Pp. 888–893.
   (a) Based     on   the   record,   respondent       Nicastro     failed  to   meet    his
burden to demonstrate that it was constitutionally proper to exercise
jurisdiction over petitioner J. McIntyre Machinery, Ltd. (British Manu
facturer).     The three primary facts the state high court relied on do not
satisfy due process.        None of the Court’s precedents  nds that a single
isolated sale, even if accompanied by the kind of sales effort indicated
here, is suf cient.       See World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, 444
U. S. 286; Asahi      Metal    Industry     Co. v. Superior     Court    of  Cal.,  Solano
Cty., 480 U. S. 102.       Here, the relevant facts show no “regular . . .  ow”
or “regular course” of sales in New Jersey, id., at 117 (Brennan, J., con
curring in part and concurring in judgment);                  id., at 122 (Stevens, J.,
concurring in part and concurring in judgment); and there is no “some
thing more,” such as special state-related design, advertising, advice, or
marketing, id., at 111, 112 (opinion of O’Connor, J.), that would warrant
the assertion of jurisdiction.          Nicastro has shown no speci c effort by
the British Manufacturer to sell in New Jersey.                 And he has not other
wise shown that the British Manufacturer “ ‘purposefully avail[ed] itself
of the privilege of conducting activities’ ” within New Jersey, or that it
delivered its goods in the stream of commerce “with the expectation
that they will be purchased” by New Jersey users.                   World-Wide Volks

   (b)  Justice Breyer would not go further.                  Because the incident at
issue does not implicate modern concerns, and because the factual rec
ord leaves many open questions, this is an unsuitable vehicle for making
broad pronouncements that refashion basic jurisdictional rules.                        At a
minimum, he would not work such a change to the law in the way either

                           Opinion of Kennedy, J.


   Justice Kennedy announced the judgment of the Court
and delivered an opinion, in which The Chief Justice, Jus
tice Scalia, and Justice Thomas join.
   Whether a person or entity is subject to the jurisdiction
of a state court despite not having been present in the State
either at the time of suit or at the time of the alleged injury,
and despite not having consented to the exercise of jurisdic
tion, is a question that arises with great frequency in the
routine course of litigation.         The rules and standards for de
termining when a State does or does not have jurisdiction
over an absent party have been unclear because of decades-
old questions left open in Asahi Metal Industry Co. v. Supe
rior Court of Cal., Solano Cty., 480 U. S. 102 (1987).
   Here, the Supreme Court of New Jersey, relying in part
on Asahi, held that New Jersey’s courts can exercise juris
diction over a foreign manufacturer of a product so long as
the manufacturer “knows or reasonably should know that its
products are distributed through a nationwide distribution
system that might lead to those products being sold in any
of the  fty states.”       Nicastro v. McIntyre Machinery Amer
ica, Ltd., 201 N. J. 48, 76, 77, 987 A. 2d 575, 591, 592 (2010).
Applying that test, the court concluded that a British manu
facturer of scrap metal machines was subject to jurisdiction
in New Jersey, even though at no time had it advertised in,
sent goods to, or in any relevant sense targeted the State.
   That decision cannot be sustained.                Although the New
Jersey Supreme Court issued an extensive opinion with care
ful attention to this Court’s cases and to its own precedent,
the “stream of commerce” metaphor carried the decision far
a eld.    Due process protects the defendant’s right not to be
coerced except by lawful judicial power.               As a general rule,
the exercise of judicial power is not lawful unless the defend
ant “purposefully avails itself of the privilege of conducting
activities within the forum State, thus invoking the bene ts
and protections of its laws.”           Hanson v. Denckla,         357 U. S.
235, 253 (1958).      There may be exceptions, say, for instance,

in cases involving an intentional tort.            But the general rule
is applicable in this products-liability case, and the so-called
“stream-of-commerce” doctrine cannot displace it.


                                      I
   This case arises from a products-liability suit  led in New
Jersey state court.         Robert Nicastro seriously injured his
hand while using a metal-shearing machine manufactured by
J. McIntyre Machinery, Ltd. (J. McIntyre).               The accident oc
curred in New Jersey, but the machine was manufactured in
England, where J. McIntyre is incorporated and operates.
The question here is whether the New Jersey courts have
jurisdiction over J. McIntyre, notwithstanding the fact that
the company at no time either marketed goods in the State
or shipped them there.          Nicastro was a plaintiff in the New
Jersey trial court and is the respondent here; J. McIntyre
was a defendant and is now the petitioner.
   At oral argument in this Court, Nicastro’s counsel stressed
three primary facts in defense of New Jersey’s assertion of
jurisdiction over J. McIntyre.            See Tr. of Oral Arg. 29–30.
   First, an independent company agreed to sell J. McIntyre’s
machines in the United States.              J. McIntyre itself did not
sell its machines to buyers in this country beyond the U. S.
distributor, and there is no allegation that the distributor
was under J. McIntyre’s control.
   Second, J. McIntyre of cials attended annual conventions
for the scrap recycling industry to advertise J. McIntyre’s
machines alongside the distributor.              The conventions took
place in various States, but never in New Jersey.
   Third, no more than four machines (the record suggests
only one, see App. to Pet. for Cert. 130a), including the ma
chine that caused the injuries that are the basis for this suit,
ended up in New Jersey.
   In addition to these facts emphasized by respondent, the
New Jersey Supreme Court noted that J. McIntyre held both
United States and European patents on its recycling technol
                         Cite as: 564 U. S. 873 (2011)                      879

ogy.    201 N. J., at 55, 987 A. 2d, at 579.            It also noted that
the U. S. distributor “structured [its] advertising and sales
efforts in accordance with” J. McIntyre’s “direction and guid
ance whenever possible,” and that “at least some of the ma
chines were sold on consignment to” the distributor.                   Id., at
55, 56, 987 A. 2d, at 579 (internal quotation marks omitted).
   In light of these facts, the New Jersey Supreme Court con
cluded that New Jersey courts could exercise jurisdiction
over petitioner without contravention of the Due Process
Clause.     Jurisdiction was proper, in that court’s view, be
cause the injury occurred in New Jersey; because petitioner
knew or reasonably should have known “that its products
are distributed through a nationwide distribution system
that might lead to those products being sold in any of the
 fty states”; and because petitioner failed to “take some rea
sonable step to prevent the distribution of its products in
this State.”      Id., at 77, 987 A. 2d, at 592.
   Both the New Jersey Supreme Court’s holding and its ac
count of what it called “[t]he stream-of-commerce doctrine of
jurisdiction,”    id.,  at 80, 987 A. 2d, at 594, were incorrect,
however.      This Court’s       Asahi    decision may be responsible
in part for that court’s error regarding the stream of com
merce, and this case presents an opportunity to provide
greater clarity.
                                      II
   The Due Process Clause protects an individual’s right to
be deprived of life, liberty, or property only by the exercise
of lawful power.        Cf. Giaccio v. Pennsylvania, 382 U. S. 399,
403 (1966) (The Clause “protect[s] a person against having
the Government impose burdens upon him except in accord
ance with the valid laws of the land”).               This is no less true
with respect to the power of a sovereign to resolve disputes
through judicial process than with respect to the power of a
sovereign to prescribe rules of conduct for those within its
sphere.     See Steel Co.      v. Citizens for     Better Environment,
523 U. S. 83, 94 (1998) (“ ‘Jurisdiction is power to declare the
880        J. McINTYRE MACHINERY, LTD.              v. NICASTRO


                          Opinion of Kennedy, J.


law’ ”).   As a general rule, neither statute nor judicial de
cree may bind strangers to the State.             Cf. Burnham v. Supe
rior Court of Cal., County of Marin, 495 U. S. 604, 608–609
(1990) (opinion of      Scalia,    J.) (invoking “the phrase          coram
non judice, ‘before a person not a judge’—meaning, in effect,
that the proceeding in question was not a               judicial proceed
ing because lawful judicial authority was not present, and
could therefore not yield a judgment”).
   A court may subject a defendant to judgment only when
the  defendant      has   suf cient     contacts    with    the   sovereign
“such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend ‘tradi
tional notions of fair play and substantial justice.’ ”                Inter
national    Shoe    Co. v.  Washington,       326 U. S. 310, 316 (1945)
(quoting Milliken v. Meyer, 311 U. S. 457, 463 (1940)).                Free-
form notions of fundamental fairness divorced from tradi
tional practice cannot transform a judgment rendered in the
absence of authority into law.           As a general rule, the sover
eign’s exercise of power requires some act by which the de
fendant “purposefully avails itself of the privilege of conduct
ing activities within        the   forum     State,   thus   invoking     the
bene ts and protections of its laws,” Hanson,                 357 U. S., at
253, though in some cases, as with an intentional tort, the
defendant might well fall within the State’s authority by rea
son of his attempt to obstruct its laws.            In products-liability
cases like this one, it is the defendant’s purposeful availment
that makes jurisdiction consistent with “traditional notions
of fair play and substantial justice.”
   A person may submit to a State’s authority in a number of
ways.     There is, of course, explicit consent.              E. g.,  Insur
ance Corp. of Ireland v. Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinee,
456 U. S. 694, 703 (1982).          Presence within a State at the
time suit commences through service of process is another
example.      See   Burnham, supra.          Citizenship or domicile—
or, by analogy, incorporation or principal place of business
for  corporations—also         indicates     general    submission      to   a
State’s powers.       Goodyear Dunlop Tires Operations, S. A.

v. Brown, post, p. 915.         Each of these examples reveals cir
cumstances, or a course of conduct, from which it is proper
to infer an intention to bene t from and thus an intention to
submit to the laws of the forum State.                   Cf.  Burger     King
Corp. v. Rudzewicz, 471 U. S. 462, 476 (1985).                 These exam
ples   support     exercise     of  the   general     jurisdiction     of  the
State’s courts and allow the State to resolve both matters
that originate within the State and those based on activities
and events elsewhere.           Helicopteros Nacionales de Colom-
bia, S. A.    v.  Hall,   466 U. S. 408, 414, and n. 9 (1984).              By
contrast, those who live or operate primarily outside a State
have a due process right not to be subjected to judgment in
its courts as a general matter.
   There is also a more limited form of submission to a State’s
authority for disputes that “arise out of or are connected
with the activities within the state.”               International       Shoe
Co., supra, at 319.        Where a defendant “purposefully avails
itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the
forum State, thus invoking the bene ts and protections of its
laws,” Hanson, supra, at 253, it submits to the judicial power
of an otherwise foreign sovereign to the extent that power
is exercised in connection with the defendant’s activities
touching on the State.          In other words, submission through
contact with and activity directed at a sovereign may justify
speci c jurisdiction “in a suit arising out of or related to the
defendant’s contacts with the forum.”                Helicopteros, supra,
at 414, n. 8; see also Goodyear, post, at 919.
   The imprecision arising from Asahi, for the most part, re
sults from its statement of the relation between jurisdiction
and the “stream of commerce.”                The stream of commerce,
like other metaphors, has its de ciencies as well as its utility.
It refers to the movement              of goods     from manufacturers
through distributors to consumers, yet beyond that descrip
tive purpose its meaning is far from exact.                This Court has
stated that a defendant’s placing goods into the stream of
commerce “with the expectation that they will be purchased
882       J. McINTYRE MACHINERY, LTD.               v. NICASTRO


                          Opinion of Kennedy, J.


by consumers in the forum State” may indicate purpose
ful availment.      World-Wide Volkswagen             Corp. v.    Woodson,
444 U. S. 286, 298 (1980) ( nding that expectation lacking).
But that statement does not amend the general rule of per
sonal jurisdiction.      It merely observes that a defendant may
in an appropriate case be subject to jurisdiction without en
tering the forum—itself an unexceptional proposition—as
where manufacturers or distributors “seek to serve” a given
State’s market.       Id., at 295.     The principal inquiry in cases
of this sort is whether the defendant’s activities manifest an
intention to submit to the power of a sovereign.                   In other
words, the defendant must “purposefully avai[l] itself of the
privilege of conducting activities within the forum State,
thus   invoking     the   bene ts     and   protections      of  its  laws.”
Hanson, supra, at 253; Insurance Corp., supra, at 704–705
(“[A]ctions of the defendant may amount to a legal submis
sion to the jurisdiction of the court”).           Sometimes a defend
ant does so by sending its goods rather than its agents.                 The
defendant’s transmission of goods permits the exercise of ju
risdiction only where the defendant can be said to have tar
geted the forum; as a general rule, it is not enough that the
defendant might have predicted that its goods will reach the
forum State.
   In Asahi, an opinion by Justice Brennan for four Justices
outlined a different approach.           It discarded the central con
cept of sovereign authority in favor of considerations of
fairness and foreseeability.         As that concurrence contended,
“jurisdiction premised on the placement of a product into the
stream of commerce [without more] is consistent with the
Due Process Clause,” for “[a]s long as a participant in this
process is aware that the  nal product is being marketed in
the forum State, the possibility of a lawsuit there cannot
come as a surprise.”          480 U. S., at 117 (opinion concurring
in part and concurring in judgment).                It was the premise
of the concurring opinion that the defendant’s ability to an
ticipate suit renders the assertion of jurisdiction fair.                  In
                         Cite as: 564 U. S. 873 (2011)                      883


                           Opinion of Kennedy, J.


this way, the opinion made foreseeability the touchstone of
jurisdiction.
   The standard set forth in Justice Brennan’s concurrence
was rejected in an opinion written by Justice O’Connor; but
the relevant part of that opinion, too, commanded the assent
of only four Justices, not a majority of the Court.               That opin
ion stated: “The ‘substantial connection’ between the defend
ant and the forum State necessary for a  nding of minimum
contacts must come about by an action of the defendant pur
posefully directed toward the forum State.                  The placement
of a product into the stream of commerce, without more,
is not an act of the defendant purposefully directed toward
the forum State.”          Id.,  at 112 (emphasis deleted; citations
omitted).
   Since Asahi was decided, the courts have sought to recon
cile  the   competing       opinions.     But    Justice    Brennan’s     con
currence, advocating a rule based on general notions of fair
ness and foreseeability, is inconsistent with the premises of
lawful judicial power.          This Court’s precedents make clear
that it is the defendant’s actions, not his expectations, that
empower a State’s courts to subject him to judgment.
   The conclusion that jurisdiction is in the  rst instance a
question of authority rather than fairness explains, for exam
ple, why the principal opinion in             Burnham        “conducted no
independent inquiry into the desirability or fairness” of the
rule that service of process within a State suf ces to estab
lish jurisdiction over an otherwise foreign defendant.                     495
U. S., at 621 (opinion of         Scalia,     J.).   As that opinion ex
plained, “[t]he view developed early that each State had the
power to hale before its courts any individual who could be
found within its borders.”           Id., at 610.     Furthermore, were
general fairness considerations the touchstone of jurisdic
tion, a lack of purposeful availment might be excused where
carefully crafted judicial procedures could otherwise protect
the defendant’s interests, or where the plaintiff would suffer
substantial hardship if forced to litigate in a foreign forum.
884        J. McINTYRE MACHINERY, LTD.              v. NICASTRO


                           Opinion of Kennedy, J.


That such considerations have not been deemed controlling
is instructive.      See,   e. g., World-Wide        Volkswagen,       supra,
at 294.
   Two principles are implicit in the foregoing.                 First, per
sonal jurisdiction requires a forum-by-forum, or sovereign
by-sovereign, analysis.          The question is whether a defend
ant has followed a course of conduct directed at the society
or economy existing within the jurisdiction of a given sover
eign, so that the sovereign has the power to subject the
defendant to judgment concerning that conduct.                      Personal
jurisdiction, of course, restricts “judicial power not as a mat
ter of sovereignty, but as a matter of individual liberty,” for
due process protects the individual’s right to be subject only
to lawful power.         Insurance     Corp.,   456 U. S., at 702.        But
whether a judicial judgment is lawful depends on whether
the sovereign has authority to render it.
   The second principle is a corollary of the  rst.                 Because
the United States is a distinct sovereign, a defendant may in
principle be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts of the
United States but not of any particular State.                  This is con
sistent with the premises and unique genius of our Constitu
tion.    Ours is “a legal system unprecedented in form and
design, establishing two orders of government, each with its
own direct relationship, its own privity, its own set of mutual
rights and obligations to the people who sustain it and are
governed by it.”        U. S. Term      Limits, Inc. v. Thornton, 514
U. S. 779, 838 (1995) (Kennedy, J., concurring).                  For juris
diction, a litigant may have the requisite relationship with
the United States Government but not with the government
of any individual State.         That would be an exceptional case,
however.      If the defendant is a domestic domiciliary, the
courts of its home State are available and can exercise gen
eral jurisdiction.      And if another State were to assert juris
diction in an inappropriate case, it would upset the federal
balance, which posits that each State has a sovereignty that
is not subject to unlawful intrusion by other States.                    Fur
                         Cite as: 564 U. S. 873 (2011)                      885

thermore, foreign corporations will often target or concen
trate on particular States, subjecting them to speci c juris
diction in those forums.
   It must be remembered, however, that although this case
and Asahi both involve foreign manufacturers, the undesir
able consequences of Justice Brennan’s approach are no less
signi cant for domestic producers.                The owner of a small
Florida farm might sell crops to a large nearby distributor,
for example, who might then distribute them to grocers
across the country.          If foreseeability were the controlling
criterion, the farmer could be sued in Alaska or any number
of other States’ courts without ever leaving town.                   And the
issue of foreseeability may itself be contested so that signi
cant expenses are incurred just on the preliminary issue of
jurisdiction.     Jurisdictional rules should avoid these costs
whenever possible.
   The conclusion that the authority to subject a defendant to
judgment depends on purposeful availment, consistent with
Justice O’Connor’s opinion in            Asahi,    does not by itself re
solve many dif cult questions of jurisdiction that will arise in
particular cases.       The defendant’s conduct and the economic
realities of the market the defendant seeks to serve will dif
fer across cases, and judicial exposition will, in common-law
fashion, clarify the contours of that principle.


                                      III
   In this case, petitioner directed marketing and sales ef
forts at the United States.          It may be that, assuming it were
otherwise empowered to legislate on the subject, the Con
gress could authorize the exercise of jurisdiction in appro
priate courts.       That circumstance is not presented in this
case, however, and it is neither necessary nor appropriate
to address here any constitutional concerns that might be
attendant to that exercise of power.               See Asahi, 480 U. S.,
at 113, n.    Nor is it necessary to determine what substantive
law might apply were Congress to authorize jurisdiction in
886        J. McINTYRE MACHINERY, LTD.              v. NICASTRO


                           Opinion of Kennedy, J.


a federal court in New Jersey.              See   Hanson,     357 U. S., at
254 (“The issue is personal jurisdiction, not choice of law”).
A sovereign’s legislative authority to regulate conduct may
present considerations different from those presented by its
authority to subject a defendant to judgment in its courts.
Here the question concerns the authority of a New Jer
sey state court to exercise jurisdiction, so it is petitioner’s
purposeful contacts with New Jersey, not with the United
States, that alone are relevant.
   Respondent has not established that J. McIntyre engaged
in conduct purposefully directed at New Jersey.                 Recall that
respondent’s claim of jurisdiction centers on three facts: The
distributor     agreed    to   sell  J.  McIntyre’s     machines      in  the
United States; J. McIntyre of cials attended trade shows in
several States but not in New Jersey; and up to four ma
chines ended up in New Jersey.               The British manufacturer
had no of ce in New Jersey; it neither paid taxes nor owned
property there; and it neither advertised in, nor sent any
employees to, the State.           Indeed, after discovery the trial
court found that the “defendant does not have a single con
tact with New Jersey short of the machine in question end
ing up in this state.”         App. to Pet. for Cert. 130a.            These
facts may reveal an intent to serve the U. S. market, but they
do not show that J. McIntyre purposefully availed itself of
the New Jersey market.
   It is notable that the New Jersey Supreme Court appears
to agree, for it could “not  nd that J. McIntyre had a pres
ence or minimum contacts in this State—in any jurispruden
tial sense—that would justify a New Jersey court to exercise
jurisdiction in this case.”        201 N. J., at 61, 987 A. 2d, at 582.
The court nonetheless held that petitioner could be sued
in New Jersey based on a “stream-of-commerce theory of
jurisdiction.”      Ibid.    As discussed, however, the stream-of
commerce metaphor cannot supersede either the mandate of
the Due Process Clause or the limits on judicial authority
that Clause ensures.          The New Jersey Supreme Court also
                        Cite as: 564 U. S. 873 (2011)                      887


                    Breyer, J., concurring in judgment


cited “signi cant policy reasons” to justify its holding, includ
ing the State’s “strong interest in protecting its citizens from
defective products.”         Id., at 75, 987 A. 2d, at 590.         That in
terest is doubtless strong, but the Constitution commands
restraint before discarding liberty in the name of expediency.
                               *      *      *
   Due process protects petitioner’s right to be subject only
to lawful authority.       At no time did petitioner engage in any
activities in New Jersey that reveal an intent to invoke or
bene t from the protection of its laws.             New Jersey is with
out power to adjudge the rights and liabilities of J. McIntyre,
and its exercise of jurisdiction would violate due process.
The contrary judgment of the New Jersey Supreme Court is


                                                                  Reversed.


   Justice     Breyer,     with whom        Justice     Alito    joins, con
curring in the judgment.
   The Supreme Court of New Jersey adopted a broad under
standing of the scope of personal jurisdiction based on its
view that “[t]he increasingly fast-paced globalization of the
world economy has removed national borders as barriers to
trade.”     Nicastro     v. McIntyre       Machinery       America,     Ltd.,
201 N. J. 48, 52, 987 A. 2d 575, 577 (2010).               I do not doubt
that there have been many recent changes in commerce
and communication, many of which are not anticipated by
our precedents.        But this case does not present any of those
issues.    So I think it unwise to announce a rule of broad
applicability without full consideration of the modern-day
consequences.
   In my view, the outcome of this case is determined by our
precedents.      Based on the facts found by the New Jersey
courts, respondent Robert Nicastro failed to meet his burden
to demonstrate that it was constitutionally proper to exer
cise jurisdiction over petitioner J. McIntyre Machinery, Ltd.
(British   Manufacturer),        a  British     rm    that   manufactures

                   Breyer, J., concurring in judgment


scrap-metal machines in Great Britain and sells them
through an independent distributor in the United States
(American Distributor).          On that basis, I agree with the plu
rality that the contrary judgment of the Supreme Court of
New Jersey should be reversed.


                                     I
   In asserting jurisdiction over the British Manufacturer,
the Supreme Court of New Jersey relied most heavily on
three primary facts as providing constitutionally suf cient
“contacts” with New Jersey, thereby making it fundamen
tally fair to hale the British Manufacturer before its courts:
(1)  The    American      Distributor     on   one   occasion    sold   and
shipped one machine to a New Jersey customer, namely,
Mr. Nicastro’s employer, Mr. Curcio; (2) the British Manufac
turer permitted, indeed wanted, its independent American
Distributor to sell its machines to anyone in America willing
to buy them; and (3) representatives of the British Manufac
turer attended trade shows in “such cities as Chicago, Las
Vegas, New Orleans, Orlando, San Diego, and San Fran
cisco.”   Id.,  at 54–55, 987 A. 2d, at 578–579.             In my view,
these facts do not provide contacts between the British  rm
and the State of New Jersey constitutionally suf cient to
support New Jersey’s assertion of jurisdiction in this case.
   None of our precedents  nds that a single isolated sale,
even if accompanied by the kind of sales effort indicated
here, is suf cient.       Rather, this Court’s previous holdings
suggest the contrary.        The Court has held that a single sale
to a customer who takes an accident-causing product to a
different State (where the accident takes place) is not a
suf cient basis for asserting jurisdiction.             See  World-Wide
Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, 444 U. S. 286 (1980).                 And the
Court, in separate opinions, has strongly suggested that a
single sale of a product in a State does not constitute an
adequate basis for asserting jurisdiction over an out-of-state
defendant, even if that defendant places his goods in the
                        Cite as: 564 U. S. 873 (2011)                      889

stream of commerce, fully aware (and hoping) that such a
sale will take place.       See Asahi Metal Industry Co. v. Supe
rior Court of Cal., Solano Cty., 480 U. S. 102, 111, 112 (1987)
(opinion of O’Connor, J.) (requiring “something more” than
simply placing “a product into the stream of commerce,”
even if defendant is “awar[e]” that the stream “may or will
sweep the product into the forum State”); id., at 117 (Bren
nan, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) ( ju
risdiction should lie where a sale in a State is part of “the
regular and anticipated  ow” of commerce into the State,
but not where that sale is only an “edd[y],” i. e., an isolated
occurrence);     id., at 122 (Stevens, J., concurring in part and
concurring in judgment) (indicating that “the volume, the
value, and the hazardous character” of a good may affect
the jurisdictional inquiry and emphasizing Asahi’s “regular
course of dealing”).
   Here, the relevant facts found by the New Jersey Supreme
Court show no “regular . . .  ow” or “regular course” of sales
in New Jersey; and there is no “something more,” such as
special state-related design, advertising, advice, marketing,
or anything else.        Mr. Nicastro, who here bears the burden
of proving jurisdiction, has shown no speci c effort by the
British Manufacturer to sell in New Jersey.                  He has intro
duced no list of potential New Jersey customers who might,
for example, have regularly attended trade shows.                    And he
has not otherwise shown that the British Manufacturer “pur
posefully avail[ed] itself of the privilege of conducting activi
ties” within New Jersey, or that it delivered its goods in the
stream of commerce “with the expectation that they will be
purchased” by New Jersey users.               World-Wide Volkswagen,
supra, at 297–298 (internal quotation marks omitted).
   There may well have been other facts that Mr. Nicastro
could have demonstrated in support of jurisdiction.                      And
the dissent considers some of those facts.                See  post,  at 895
(opinion of    Ginsburg, J.) (describing the size and scope of
New Jersey’s scrap-metal business).              But the plaintiff bears

the burden of establishing jurisdiction, and here I would take
the facts precisely as the New Jersey Supreme Court stated
them.     Insurance Corp. of Ireland v. Compagnie des Baux
ites de Guinee, 456 U. S. 694, 709 (1982); Blakey v. Continen
tal Airlines, Inc., 164 N. J. 38, 71, 751 A. 2d 538, 557 (2000);
see 201 N. J., at 54–56, 987 A. 2d, at 578–579; App. to Pet.
for Cert. 128a–137a (trial court’s “reasoning and  nding(s)”).
   Accordingly, on the record present here, resolving this
case requires no more than adhering to our precedents.


                                      II
   I would not go further.          Because the incident at issue in
this case does not implicate modern concerns, and because
the factual record leaves many open questions, this is an un
suitable vehicle for making broad pronouncements that re
fashion basic jurisdictional rules.


                                      A
   The plurality seems to state strict rules that limit jurisdic
tion where a defendant does not “inten[d] to submit to the
power of a sovereign” and cannot “be said to have targeted
the forum.”        Ante,   at 882.     But what do those standards
mean when a company targets the world by selling products
from its Web site?         And does it matter if, instead of ship
ping the products directly, a company consigns the products
through an intermediary (say,             Amazon.com) who then            re
ceives and ful lls the orders?             And what if the company
markets its products through popup advertisements that it
knows will be viewed in a forum?             Those issues have serious
commercial consequences but are totally absent in this case.


                                      B
   But though I do not agree with the plurality’s seemingly
strict no-jurisdiction rule, I am not persuaded by the abso
lute approach adopted by the New Jersey Supreme Court
and urged by respondent and his amici.                  Under that view,
                         Cite as: 564 U. S. 873 (2011)                      891


                    Breyer, J., concurring in judgment


a producer is subject to jurisdiction for a products-liability
action so long as it “knows or reasonably should know that
its products are distributed through a nationwide distribu
tion system that might lead to those products being sold in
any of the  fty states.”         201 N. J., at 76–77, 987 A. 2d, at 592
(emphasis added).          In   the   context    of  this   case,   I  cannot
agree.
   For one thing, to adopt this view would abandon the here
tofore accepted inquiry of whether, focusing upon the rela
tionship between “the defendant, the                 forum,    and the liti
gation,” it is fair, in light of the defendant’s contacts                 with
that forum, to subject the defendant to suit there.                   Shaffer
v.  Heitner,    433 U. S. 186, 204 (1977) (emphasis added).                  It
would     ordinarily     rest   jurisdiction    instead     upon    no   more
than    the   occurrence      of  a   product-based       accident     in  the
forum State.        But this Court has rejected the notion that a
defendant’s amenability to suit “travel[s] with the chattel.”
World-Wide Volkswagen, 444 U. S., at 296.
   For another, I cannot reconcile so automatic a rule with
the constitutional demand for “minimum contacts” and “pur
posefu[l] avail[ment],” each of which rests upon a particular
notion of defendant-focused fairness.              Id., at 291, 297 (inter
nal quotation marks omitted).              A rule like the New Jersey
Supreme Court’s would permit every State to assert juris
diction in a products-liability suit against any domestic man
ufacturer     who    sells   its  products     (made    anywhere       in  the
United States) to a national distributor, no matter how large
or small the manufacturer, no matter how distant the forum,
and no matter how few the number of items that end up in
the particular forum at issue.             What might appear fair in
the case of a large manufacturer which speci cally seeks, or
expects, an equal-sized distributor to sell its product in a
distant State might seem unfair in the case of a small manu
facturer (say, an Appalachian potter) who sells his product

State (Hawaii).       I know too little about the range of these
or in-between possibilities to abandon in favor of the more
absolute rule what has previously been this Court’s less ab
solute approach.
   Further, the fact that the defendant is a foreign, rather
than a domestic, manufacturer makes the basic fairness of an
absolute rule yet more uncertain.              I am again less certain
than is the New Jersey Supreme Court that the nature of
international commerce has changed so signi cantly as to re
quire a new approach to personal jurisdiction.
   It may be that a larger  rm can readily “alleviate the risk
of burdensome litigation by procuring insurance, passing the
expected costs on to customers, or, if the risks are too great,
severing its connection with the State.”             World-Wide Volks
wagen,    supra,    at 297.     But manufacturers come in many
shapes and sizes.       It may be fundamentally unfair to require
a small Egyptian shirtmaker, a Brazilian manufacturing co
operative, or a Kenyan coffee farmer, selling its products
through international distributors, to respond to products-
liability tort suits in virtually every State in the United
States, even those in respect to which the foreign  rm has
no connection at all but the sale of a single (allegedly defec
tive) good.     And a rule like the New Jersey Supreme Court
suggests would require every product manufacturer, large or
small, selling to American distributors to understand not
only the tort law of every State, but also the wide variance
in the way courts within different States apply that law.

such considerations are relevant to any change in present
law, they might be presented in a case (unlike the present

   This case presents no such occasion, and so I again reiter
ate that I would adhere strictly to our precedents and the
limited facts found by the New Jersey Supreme Court.                     And
on those grounds, I do not think we can  nd jurisdiction in
this case.     Accordingly, though I agree with the plurality as
to the outcome of this case, I concur only in the judgment of
that opinion and not its reasoning.

Justice Kagan join, dissenting.
   A foreign industrialist seeks to develop a market in the
United States for machines it manufactures.                 It hopes to de
rive substantial revenue from sales it makes to United States
purchasers.       Where in the United States buyers reside does
not matter to this manufacturer.              Its goal is simply to sell
as much as it can, wherever it can.             It excludes no region or
State from the market it wishes to reach.                  But, all things
considered, it prefers to avoid products liability litigation in
the United States.         To that end, it engages a U. S. distrib
utor to ship its machines stateside.                Has it succeeded in
escaping personal jurisdiction in a State where one of its
products is sold and causes injury or even death to a local
user?
   Under this Court’s pathmarking precedent in                     Interna
tional Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U. S. 310 (1945), and sub
sequent decisions, one would expect the answer to be un
equivocally, “No.”        But instead, six Justices of this Court, in
divergent opinions, tell us that the manufacturer has avoided
the jurisdiction of our state courts, except perhaps in States
where its products are sold in sizeable quantities.                    Incon

   On October 11, 2001, a three-ton metal shearing machine
severed four  ngers on Robert Nicastro’s right hand.                     Ni

53, 987 A. 2d 575, 577 (2010); see App. 6a–8a (Complaint).
Alleging that the machine was a dangerous product defec
tively made, Nicastro sought compensation from the ma
chine’s manufacturer, J. McIntyre Machinery, Ltd. (McIntyre
UK).     Established in 1872 as a United Kingdom corporation,
and headquartered in Nottingham, England, McIntyre UK
“designs, develops and manufactures a complete range of
equipment for metal recycling.”            Id., at 22a, 33a.      The com
pany’s product line, as advertised on McIntyre UK’s Web
site, includes “metal shears, balers, cable and can recycling
equipment, furnaces, casting equipment and . . . the world’s
best aluminium dross processing and cooling system.”                     Id.,
at 31a.    McIntyre UK holds both United States and Euro
pean patents on its technology.            201 N. J., at 55, 987 A. 2d,
at 579; App. 36a.
   The machine that injured Nicastro, a “McIntyre Model 640
Shear,” sold in the United States for $24,900 in 1995, id., at
43a, and features a “massive cutting capacity,”                id., at 44a.
According to McIntyre UK’s product brochure, the machine
is  “use[d]   throughout      the   [w]orld.”     Ibid.    McIntyre      UK
represented in the brochure that, by “incorporat[ing] off-
the-shelf hydraulic parts from suppliers with international
sales outlets,” the 640 Shear’s design guarantees serviceabil

   Nicastro operated the 640 Shear in the course of his em
ployment at Curcio Scrap Metal (CSM) in Saddle Brook, New
Jersey.     Id., at 7a, 43a.    “New Jersey has long been a hotbed

3,000   potential    buyers     of  scrap    processing      and   recycling
equipment attend its annual conventions, “primarily because
th[e] exposition provides them with the most comprehensive
industry-related shopping experience concentrated in a sin

   McIntyre UK representatives attended every ISRI con

annual expositions were held in diverse venues across the
United States; in addition to Las Vegas, conventions were
held in New Orleans, Orlando, San Antonio, and San Fran
cisco.   Ibid.    McIntyre       UK’s    president,     Michael     Pownall,
regularly attended ISRI conventions.                 Ibid.    He attended
ISRI’s Las Vegas convention the year CSM’s owner  rst

McIntyre UK exhibited its products at ISRI trade shows,
the company acknowledged, hoping to reach “anyone inter
ested in the machine from anywhere in the United States.”
Id., at 161a.
   Although McIntyre UK’s U. S. sales  gures are not in the
record, it appears that for several years in the 1990’s, earn
ings from sales of McIntyre UK products in the United
States “ha[d] been good” in comparison to “the rest of the
world.”     Id.,  at 136a (Letter from Sally Johnson, McIntyre
UK’s Managing Director, to Gary and Mary Gaither, of cers
of McIntyre UK’s exclusive distributor in the United States
(Jan. 13, 1999)).       In response to interrogatories, McIntyre
UK stated that its commissioning engineer had installed the
company’s equipment in several States—Illinois, Iowa, Ken
tucky, Virginia, and Washington.             Id., at 119a.
   From at least 1995 until 2001, McIntyre UK retained an
Ohio-based      company,      McIntyre      Machinery       America,     Ltd.

A. 2d, at 95.     In invoices and other written communications,
McIntyre America described itself as McIntyre UK’s na
tional distributor, “America’s Link” to “Quality Metal Proc
essing Equipment” from England.               App. 43a, 78a.
   In a November 23, 1999 letter to McIntyre America, McIn
tyre UK’s president spoke plainly about the manufacturer’s
objective in authorizing the exclusive distributorship: “All
we wish to do is sell our products in the [United] States—
and get paid!”        Id., at 134a.      Notably, McIntyre America
was concerned about U. S. litigation involving McIntyre UK
products, in which the distributor had been named as a de
fendant.     McIntyre UK counseled McIntyre America to re
spond personally to the litigation, but reassured its distribu
tor that “the product was built and designed by McIntyre
Machinery in the UK and the buck stops here—if there’s
something      wrong    with    the   machine.”      Id.,  at  129a–130a.
Answering jurisdictional interrogatories, McIntyre UK
stated that it had been named as a defendant in lawsuits
in  Illinois,   Kentucky,     Massachusetts,       and   West     Virginia.
Id.,  at 98a, 108a.      And in correspondence with McIntyre
America, McIntyre UK noted that the manufacturer had
products liability insurance coverage.            Id., at 129a.
   Over the years, McIntyre America distributed several Mc
Intyre UK products to U. S. customers, including, in addition
to the 640 Shear, McIntyre UK’s “Niagara” and “Tardis” sys
tems, wire strippers, and can machines.               Id.,  at 123a–128a.
In promoting McIntyre UK’s products at conventions and
demonstration sites and in trade journal advertisements, Mc
Intyre America looked to McIntyre UK for direction and
guidance.      Ibid.   To achieve McIntyre UK’s objective, i. e.,
“to sell [its] machines to customers throughout the United
States,” 399 N. J. Super., at 548, 945 A. 2d, at 97, “the two
companies were acting closely in concert with each other,”
ibid.   McIntyre UK never instructed its distributor to avoid
certain States or regions of the country; rather, as just

                           Ginsburg, J., dissenting


noted, the manufacturer engaged McIntyre America to
attract customers “from anywhere in the United States.”
App. 161a.
   In sum, McIntyre UK’s regular attendance and exhibitions
at ISRI conventions was surely a purposeful step to reach
customers for its products “anywhere in the United States.”
At least as purposeful was McIntyre UK’s engagement of
McIntyre America as the conduit for sales of McIntyre UK’s
machines to buyers “throughout the United States.”                         Given
McIntyre       UK’s     endeavors      to   reach     and    pro t    from    the
United States market as a whole, Nicastro’s suit, I would
hold, has been brought in a forum entirely appropriate for
the adjudication of          his   claim.     He   alleges that       McIntyre
UK’s shear machine was defectively designed or manufac
tured and, as a result, caused injury to him at his workplace.
The machine arrived in Nicastro’s New Jersey workplace not
randomly or fortuitously, but as a result of the U. S. connec
tions and distribution system that McIntyre UK deliberately
arranged.3       On what sensible view of the allocation of adju
dicatory authority could the place of Nicastro’s injury within
the United States be deemed off limits for his products liabil
ity claim against a foreign manufacturer who targeted the
United States (including all the States that constitute the
Nation) as the territory it sought to develop?


  3 McIntyre UK resisted Nicastro’s efforts to determine whether other
McIntyre machines had been sold to New Jersey customers.               See id., at
100a–101a.    McIntyre did allow that McIntyre America “may have resold
products it purchased from [McIntyre UK] to a buyer in New Jersey,” id.,
at 117a, but said it kept no record of the ultimate destination of machines
it shipped to its distributor, ibid.   A private investigator engaged by Ni
castro found at least one McIntyre UK machine, of unspeci ed type, in
use in New Jersey.      Id., at 140a–144a.    But McIntyre UK objected that
the investigator’s report was “unsworn and based upon hearsay.”             Reply
Brief 10.   Moreover, McIntyre UK maintained, no evidence showed that
the machine the investigator found in New Jersey had been “sold into [that
State].”   Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).

                                      II
   A few points on which there should be no genuine debate
bear statement at the outset.           First, all agree, McIntyre UK
surely is not subject to general (all-purpose) jurisdiction in
New Jersey courts, for that foreign-country corporation is
hardly “at home” in New Jersey.                 See    Goodyear      Dunlop
Tires Operations, S. A. v. Brown, post, at 919–920, 926–929.
The question, rather, is one of speci c jurisdiction, which
turns on an “af liatio[n] between the forum and the underly
ing controversy.”        Goodyear      Dunlop,     post,   at 919 (quoting
von Mehren & Trautman, Jurisdiction To Adjudicate: A Sug
gested Analysis, 79 Harv. L. Rev. 1121, 1136 (1966) (herein
after von Mehren & Trautman) (internal quotation marks
omitted)); see also Goodyear Dunlop, post, at 923–924.
   Second, no issue of the fair and reasonable allocation of
adjudicatory authority among States of the United States
is present in this case.         New Jersey’s exercise of personal
jurisdiction over a foreign manufacturer whose dangerous
product caused a workplace injury in New Jersey does not
tread on the domain, or diminish the sovereignty, of any
other State.      Indeed, among States of the United States, the
State in which the injury occurred would seem most suitable
for litigation of a products liability tort claim.              See World-
Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, 444 U. S. 286, 297 (1980)
(if a manufacturer or distributor endeavors to develop a mar
ket for a product in several States, it is reasonable “to sub
ject it to suit in one of those States if its allegedly defective
[product] has there been the source of injury”); 28 U. S. C.
§ 1391(a)–(b) (in federal-court suits, whether resting on di
versity or federal-question jurisdiction, venue is proper in
the judicial district “in which a substantial part of the events
or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred”).
   Third, the constitutional limits on a state court’s adjudi
catory authority derive from considerations of due process,
not state sovereignty.         As the Court clari ed in Insurance
900        J. McINTYRE MACHINERY, LTD.              v. NICASTRO

Corp. of Ireland v. Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinee, 456
U. S. 694 (1982):
      “The restriction on state sovereign power described in
      World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. . . . must be seen as ulti
      mately a function of the individual liberty interest pre
      served by the Due Process Clause.               That Clause is the
      only source of the personal jurisdiction requirement and
      the Clause itself makes no mention of federalism con
      cerns.     Furthermore, if the federalism concept operated
      as an independent restriction on the sovereign power of
      the court, it would not be possible to waive the personal
      jurisdiction requirement: Individual actions cannot
      change the powers of sovereignty, although the individ
      ual can subject himself to powers from which he may
      otherwise be protected.”           Id., at 703, n. 10.


See also     Shaffer    v. Heitner,     433 U. S. 186, 204, and n. 20
(1977) (recognizing that “the mutually exclusive sovereignty
of the States [is not] the central concern of the inquiry
into personal jurisdiction”).          But see ante, at 882 (plurality
opinion)     (asserting    that   “sovereign      authority,”     not   “fair
ness,”    is  the   “central    concept”      in  determining       personal
jurisdiction).
   Finally, in International Shoe itself, and decisions thereaf
ter, the Court has made plain that legal  ctions, notably
“presence” and “implied consent,” should be discarded, for
they conceal the actual bases on which jurisdiction rests.
See 326 U. S., at 316, 318;         Hutchinson       v. Chase    &   Gilbert,
Inc., 45 F. 2d 139, 141 (CA2 1930) (L. Hand, J.) (“nothing is
gained by [resort to words that] concea[l] what we do”).
“[T]he relationship among the defendant, the forum, and the
litigation” determines whether due process permits the exer
cise of personal jurisdiction over a defendant,                Shaffer,   433
U. S., at 204, and “ ctions of implied consent” or “corporate
presence” do not advance the proper inquiry,                    id., at 202.
See also     Burnham       v.  Superior     Court    of  Cal.,   County     of

“presence”).
    Whatever the state of academic debate over the role of
consent in modern jurisdictional doctrines,4                        the plurality’s
notion that consent is the animating concept draws no sup
port from controlling decisions of this Court.                             Quite the
contrary, the Court has explained, a forum can exercise ju
risdiction when its contacts with the controversy are suf
cient; invocation of a  ctitious consent, the Court has repeat
edly said, is unnecessary and unhelpful.                        See,   e. g.,  Burger

                                       III
   This case is illustrative of marketing arrangements for
sales in the United States common in today’s commercial
world.6     A foreign-country manufacturer engages a U. S.
company to promote and distribute the manufacturer’s prod
ucts, not in any particular State, but anywhere and every
where in the United States the distributor can attract pur
chasers.      The product proves defective and injures a user in
the State where the user lives or works.                 Often, as here, the
manufacturer will have liability insurance covering personal
injuries caused by its products.                 See   Cupp, Redesigning
Successor Liability, 1999 U. Ill. L. Rev. 845, 870–871 (not
ing   the   ready     availability     of  products      liability   insurance
for manufacturers and citing a study showing, “between 1986
and 1996, [such] insurance cost manufacturers, on average,
only sixteen cents for each $100 of product sales”); App.
129a–130a.
   When industrial accidents happen, a long-arm statute in
the State where the injury occurs generally permits asser
tion of jurisdiction, upon giving proper notice, over the for
eign manufacturer.           For example, the State’s statute might
provide, as does New York’s long-arm statute, for the “exer
cise [of] personal jurisdiction over any non-domiciliary . . .
who . . .
      “commits a tortious act without the state causing injury
      to person or property within the state, . . . if he . . .
      expects or should reasonably expect the act to have con
      sequences in the state and derives substantial revenue

                            Ginsburg, J., dissenting


On what measure of reason and fairness can it be considered
undue to require McIntyre UK to defend in New Jersey as
an incident of its efforts to develop a market for its industrial
machines anywhere and everywhere in the United States?12


Is not the burden on McIntyre UK to defend in New Jersey
fair,  i. e., a reasonable cost of transacting business interna
tionally, in comparison to the burden on Nicastro to go to
Nottingham, England, to gain recompense for an injury he
sustained using McIntyre’s product at his workplace in Sad
dle Brook, New Jersey?
   McIntyre UK dealt with the United States as a single mar
ket.    Like most foreign manufacturers, it was concerned not
with the prospect of suit in State X as opposed to State Y,
but rather with its subjection to suit anywhere in the United
States.       See Hay, Judicial Jurisdiction Over Foreign-
Country Corporate Defendants—Comments on Recent Case
Law, 63 Ore. L. Rev. 431, 433 (1984) (hereinafter Hay).                        As
a  McIntyre       UK     of cer     wrote    in   an   e-mail    to   McIntyre
America: “American law—who needs it?!”                       App. 129a–130a
(e-mail dated April 26, 1999, from Sally Johnson to Mary
Gaither).      If  McIntyre       UK     is  answerable        in  the   United
States at all, is it not “perfectly appropriate to permit the exer
cise of that jurisdiction . . . at the place of injury”?                See Hay
435; Degnan & Kane, The Exercise of Jurisdiction Over and
Enforcement of Judgments Against Alien Defendants, 39


of lex loci delicti, the location of injury continues to hold sway in choice-
of-law analysis in tort cases.     See generally Whytock, Myth of Mess? In
ternational Choice of Law in Action, 84 N. Y. U. L. Rev. 719 (2009).
   12 The plurality suggests that the Due Process Clause might permit a
federal district court in New Jersey, sitting in diversity and applying New
Jersey law, to adjudicate McIntyre UK’s liability to Nicastro.          See ante,
at 885–886.    In other words, McIntyre UK might be compelled to bear
the burden of traveling to New Jersey and defending itself there under
New Jersey’s products liability law, but would be entitled to federal adjudi
cation of Nicastro’s state-law claim.      I see no basis in the Due Process
Clause for such a curious limitation.

national order,” the State that counts is the United States,
not its component States,13              and that the fair place of suit
within the United States is essentially a question of venue).
    In sum, McIntyre UK, by engaging McIntyre America to
promote and sell its machines in the United States, “purpose
fully availed itself ” of the United States market nationwide,
not a market in a single State or a discrete collection of
States.      McIntyre UK thereby availed itself of the market
of all States in which its products were sold by its exclusive
distributor.        “Th[e] ‘purposeful availment’ requirement,”
this Court has explained, simply “ensures that a defendant
will not be haled into a jurisdiction solely as a result of ‘ran
dom,’ ‘fortuitous,’ or ‘attenuated’ contacts.”                     Burger     King,
471 U. S., at 475.          Adjudicatory authority is appropriately
exercised where “actions by the defendant                        himself ” give
rise to the af liation with the forum.                 Ibid.     How could Mc
Intyre UK not have intended, by its actions targeting a na

the largest scrap metal market?                 See supra, at 895, 902, n. 6.
But see ante,       at 886 (plurality opinion) (manufacturer’s pur
poseful efforts to sell its products nationwide are “not . . .
relevant” to the personal jurisdiction inquiry).

                          Ginsburg, J., dissenting


   Courts, both state and federal, confronting facts similar
to those here, have rightly rejected the conclusion that a
manufacturer selling its products across the USA may evade
jurisdiction in any and all States, including the State where
its defective product is distributed and causes injury.                 They
have held, instead, that it would undermine principles of fun
damental fairness to insulate the foreign manufacturer from
accountability in court at the place within the United States
where the manufacturer’s products caused injury.                   See, e. g.,
Tobin v.    Astra Pharmaceutical Prods., Inc.,              993 F. 2d 528,

   While this Court has not considered in any prior case the
now-prevalent       pattern     presented     here—a      foreign-country
manufacturer enlisting a U. S. distributor to develop a mar
ket in the United States for the manufacturer’s products—
none of the Court’s decisions tug against the judgment made
by the New Jersey Supreme Court.                McIntyre contends oth
erwise, citing World-Wide Volkswagen and Asahi Metal In
dustry Co. v. Superior Court of Cal., Solano Cty., 480 U. S.
102 (1987).
   World-Wide Volkswagen concerned a New York car deal
ership that sold solely in the New York market, and a New
York distributor who supplied retailers in three States only:
New York, Connecticut, and New Jersey.                   444 U. S., at 289.
New York residents had purchased an Audi from the New
York dealer and were driving the new vehicle through Okla
homa en route to Arizona.              On the road in Oklahoma, an
other car struck the Audi in the rear, causing a  re which
severely burned the Audi’s occupants.               Id., at 288.     Reject

New York dealer and distributor, this Court observed that
the defendants had done nothing to serve the market for cars
in Oklahoma.        Id., at 295–298.      Jurisdiction, the Court held,
could not be based on the customer’s unilateral act of driving
the vehicle to Oklahoma.           Id., at 298; see Asahi, 480 U. S.,
at 109 (opinion of O’Connor, J.) (World-Wide                   Volkswagen
“rejected the assertion that a           consumer’s      unilateral act of
bringing the defendant’s product into the forum State was a
suf cient constitutional basis for personal jurisdiction over
the defendant”).
   Notably, the foreign manufacturer of the Audi in                  World-
Wide    Volkswagen       did not object to the jurisdiction of the
Oklahoma courts and the U. S. importer abandoned its ini
tially stated objection.         444 U. S., at 288, and n. 3.            And
most relevant here, the Court’s opinion indicates that an
objection to jurisdiction by the manufacturer or national
distributor would have been unavailing.                 To reiterate, the
Court said in World-Wide Volkswagen that, when a manufac
turer or distributor aims to sell its product to customers in
several States, it is reasonable “to subject it to suit in [any]
one of those States if its allegedly defective [product] has
there been the source of injury.”            Id., at 297.
   Asahi    arose out of a motorcycle accident in California.
Plaintiff, a California resident injured in the accident, sued
the Taiwanese manufacturer of the motorcycle’s tire tubes,
claiming that defects in its product caused the accident.
The tube manufacturer cross-claimed against Asahi, the Jap
anese maker of the valve assembly, and Asahi contested the
California courts’ jurisdiction.         By the time the case reached
this Court, the injured plaintiff had settled his case and only
the indemnity claim by the Taiwanese company against the
Japanese valve-assembly manufacturer remained.
   The decision was not a close call.             The Court had before
it a foreign plaintiff, the Taiwanese manufacturer, and a
foreign defendant, the Japanese valve-assembly maker, and
the indemni cation dispute concerned a transaction between

those parties that occurred abroad.               All agreed on the bot
tom line: The Japanese valve-assembly manufacturer was
not reasonably brought into the California courts to litigate
a dispute with another foreign party over a transaction that
took place outside the United States.
   Given the con nes of the controversy, the dueling opinions
of Justice Brennan and Justice O’Connor were hardly neces
sary.    How the Court would have “estimate[d] . . . the incon
veniences,”      International       Shoe,    326   U. S.,   at   317   (inter
nal quotation marks omitted), had the injured Californian
originally sued Asahi is a debatable question.                    Would this
Court have given the same weight to the burdens on the
foreign defendant had those been counterbalanced by the
burdens litigating in Japan imposed on the local California
plaintiff?     Cf.  Calder     v.  Jones,    465   U. S.    783,   788   (1984)
(a plaintiff ’s contacts with the forum “may be so manifold
as to permit jurisdiction when it would not exist in their
absence”).
   In any event, Asahi, unlike McIntyre UK, did not itself
seek out customers in the United States, it engaged no dis
tributor to promote its wares here, it appeared at no trade-
shows in the United States, and, of course, it had no Web site
advertising its products to the world.               Moreover, Asahi was
a component-part manufacturer with “little control over the
 nal destination of its products once they were delivered into
the stream of commerce.”              A. Uberti, 181 Ariz., at 572, 892
P. 2d, at 1361.      It was important to the Court in Asahi that
“those who use Asahi components in their  nal products, and
sell those products in California, [would be] subject to the
application of California tort law.”             480 U. S., at 115 (major
ity opinion).      To hold that Asahi controls this case would, to
put it bluntly, be dead wrong.15


  15 The plurality notes the low volume of sales in New Jersey, ante, at
878, 886.   A $24,900 shearing machine, however, is unlikely to sell in bulk
worldwide, much less in any given State.        By dollar value, the price of a
single machine represents a signi cant sale.       Had a manufacturer sold in

   The Court’s judgment also puts United States plaintiffs at
a disadvantage in comparison to similarly situated complain
ants elsewhere in the world.               Of particular note, within the
European Union, in which the United Kingdom is a partici
pant, the jurisdiction New Jersey would have exercised is
not at all exceptional.           The European Regulation on Juris
diction and the Recognition and Enforcement of Judgments
provides for the exercise of speci c jurisdiction “in matters
relating to tort . . . in the courts for the place where the
harmful event occurred.”              Council Reg. 44/2001, Art. 5, 2001
O.   J. (L. 12) 4.16       The European Court of Justice has in
terpreted this prescription to authorize jurisdiction either
where the harmful act occurred or at the place of injury.

   The commentators who gave names to what we now call
“general jurisdiction” and “speci c jurisdiction” anticipated
that when the latter achieves its full growth, considerations
of litigational convenience and the respective situations of
the parties would determine when it is appropriate to sub-

Shoji Co., 715 F. 2d 1355 (CA9 1983), the Court would presumably  nd the
defendant amenable to suit in that State.16 The Regulation replaced the “European” or “Brussels” Convention on
Jurisdiction and Enforcement of Judgments in Civil and Commercial Mat
ters, entered into in 1968 by the original Common Market member states.

the parties, courts would differently appraise two situations:
(1)  cases involving a substantially local plaintiff, like Nicas
tro, injured by the activity of a defendant engaged in inter
state or international trade; and (2) cases in which the de
fendant is a natural or legal person whose economic activities
and legal involvements are largely home based, i. e., entities
without designs to gain substantial revenue from sales in
distant markets.         See id., at 1167–1169.18          As the attached

plaintiff injured by the activity of a manufacturer seeking
to exploit a multistate or global market—have repeatedly

heart that the plurality opinion does not speak for the Court,

   Clune     v.  Alimak      AB,    233   F.  3d   538,   544   (CA8     2000)
(wrongful-death action against the Swedish manufacturer of
a construction hoist that allegedly caused a workplace death
in Missouri; holding the manufacturer amenable to suit in
Missouri, the Eighth Circuit stated: “Although we can imag
ine a case where a foreign manufacturer selects discrete
regional     distributors     for   the   purpose     of  penetrating      the
markets in some states to the exclusion of others, that situa
tion is not before us.”          In this case, the foreign manufac
turer had “successfully employ[ed] one or two distributors to
cover the [entire] United States[,] intend[ing] to reap the
bene t of sales in every state where those distributors mar
ket.”    Were the court to conclude that the manufacturer
“did not intend its products to  ow into Missouri,” the court
“would be bound to the conclusion that the [manufacturer]
did not intend its products to  ow into                any of the United
States.”).
   Kernan      v. Kurz-Hastings,        Inc.,   175 F. 3d 236, 242–244
(CA2 1999) (products liability action against the Japanese
manufacturer of an allegedly defective stamping press that
caused a workplace injury in New York; holding the manu
facturer amenable to suit in New York, the Second Circuit
stated that an “exclusive sales rights agreement” between
the Japanese manufacturer and a Pennsylvania distributor
“contemplates that [the distributor] will sell [the manufactur
er’s] machines in North America and throughout the world,
serv[ing]    as   evidence     of   [the  manufacturer’s]        attempt     to
serve the New York market, albeit indirectly” (internal quo

Nebraska; Eighth Circuit held the manufacturer amenable to
suit in Nebraska, although the manufacturer had no distribu
tor or sales agents in that State, did not advertise in Ne
braska, and claimed it was unaware that its distributors
sold products there; Court of Appeals stated: “In this age
of [North American Free Trade Agreement] and [General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade], one can expect further
globalization of commerce, and it is only reasonable for com
panies that distribute allegedly defective products through
regional distributors in this country to anticipate being haled
into court by plaintiffs in their home states.”).
  Tobin v. Astra Pharmaceutical Prods., Inc., 993 F. 2d 528,
544 (CA6 1993) (products liability action against the Dutch
pharmaceutical       manufacturer        of  a  drug    alleged    to   have
caused Kentucky resident’s heart disease; holding the manu
facturer amenable to suit in Kentucky, the Sixth Circuit rea
soned: “[Defendant] argues that it has done nothing in partic
ular to purposefully avail itself of the Kentucky market as
distinguished from any other state in the union.                If we were
to accept defendant’s argument on this point, a foreign manu
facturer could insulate itself from liability in each of the  fty
states simply by using an independent national distributor
to market its products.”).
  Hedrick v. Daiko Shoji Co., 715 F. 2d 1355, 1358 (CA9 1983)
(products liability suit arising from injuries plaintiff sus
tained in Oregon caused by an allegedly defective wire-rope
splice manufactured in Japan; holding the Japanese manufac
turer amenable to suit in Oregon, the Ninth Circuit noted
that the manufacturer “performed a forum-related act when
it produced a splice that it knew was destined for ocean
going vessels serving United States ports, including those
of Oregon”).

by worker injured in Virginia while using a rail-cutting saw
manufactured by a French corporation; holding the manufac

Dutch manufacturer of a poultry processing machine that al
legedly caused injury in Pennsylvania; holding the manufac
turer amenable to suit in Pennsylvania, the District Court
observed that the manufacturer “clearly and purposefully
used [distributors] to deal in the international market for

equipment was being sold for use in the United States, in
cluding Pennsylvania”).

allegedly defective seatbelt; Supreme Court of Alabama held
the manufacturer amenable to suit in Alabama, although the

that it knew its products were being marketed in Alabama”).

1354, 1362 (1995) (wrongful-death action against the Italian
manufacturer of an allegedly defective handgun that caused
child’s death in Arizona; Arizona Supreme Court stated:
“[F]or all this record shows, Defendant never heard of Ari
zona.    This raises the following question: Having shown that
the gun was knowingly designed for and exported to exploit
the market of the United States or western United States,
must Plaintiffs additionally show that Defendant had the
speci c intent to market the gun in Arizona, or is it enough
to show that Defendant intended to market it in any state,
group of states, or all states?            We conclude that only the
latter is necessary.”).

              BURGER           KING       CORP.        v. RUDZEWICZ


APPEAL        FROM      THE UNITED           STATES      COURT       OF   APPEALS        FOR
                             THE    ELEVENTH          CIRCUIT
       No.  83-2097.       Argued    January     8, 1985--Decided       May   20,  1985
Appellant    is a Florida corporation       whose    principal   offices are in  Miami.      It
   conducts    most   of  its restaurant    business    through    a franchise    operation,
   under    which   franchisees    are  licensed   to  use  appellant's    trademarks      and
   service   marks    in leased   standardized     restaurant    facilities for  a period    of
   20  years.     The   governing contracts       provide    that  the  franchise    relation-
   ship  is established     in  Miami    and  governed     by   Florida   law,  and   call  for
   payment      of all  required    monthly     fees   and   forwarding     of  all  relevant
   notices   to the Miami headquarters.           The Miami     headquarters sets policy
   and   works    directly  with   the  franchisees    in  attempting     to  resolve   major
   problems.       Day-to-day monitoring        of franchisees,    however,    is conducted
   through    district   offices  that  in  turn  report   to  the  Miami    headquarters.
   Appellee    is a  Michigan    resident    who,   along   with another     Michigan     resi-
   dent, entered     into  a 20-year    franchise   contract   with appellant to operate
   a restaurant    in Michigan.       Subsequently,      when    the restaurant's     patron-
   age   declined,    the  franchisees     fell  behind   in  their   monthly     payments.
   After    extended     negotiations    among     the  franchisees,    the   Michigan     dis-
   trict  office, and   the  Miami    headquarters      proved    unsuccessful     in solving
   the   problem,    headquarters terminated           the   franchise    and  ordered     the
   franchisees    to  vacate   the premises.       They   refused    and  continued     to op-
   erate   the restaurant.       Appellant then     brought    a diversity    action in  Fed-
   eral  District  Court in    Florida,   alleging   that the   franchisees    had breached
   their franchise    obligations    and  requesting     damages     and  injunctive   relief.
   The   franchisees    claimed   that,  because    they were     Michigan residents       and
   because    appellant's    claim did     not  "arise"   within    Florida, the     District
   Court    lacked  personal    jurisdiction    over them.       But the    court   held  that
   the  franchisees     were   subject    to personal    jurisdiction   pursuant     to  Flor-
   ida's long-arm    statute, which     extends jurisdiction      to any person,     whether
   or  not  a citizen  or resident    of the   State,  who    breaches    a contract   in  the
   State by failing to perform acts that the contract requires to be performed
   there.    Thereafter,      the court   entered judgment        against the    franchisees
   on  the merits.      The   Court   of Appeals reversed,       holding   that  "[j]urisdic-
   tion  under    these   circumstances      would    offend   the  fundamental      fairness
   which    is the touchstone     of due   process."
Held:    The   District   Court's   exercise    of jurisdiction    pursuant     to  Florida's
   long-arm     statute   did  not violate    the   Due   Process    Clause    of the   Four-
   teenth   Amendment.          Pp.  471-487.

                                defendant             himself that               are     purposefully               directed          toward          forum        resi-

                                substantial justice."                        Jurisdiction             in    these       circumstances                may       not      be
                                avoided           merely          because           the     defendant             did     not     physically             enter        the
                                forum.            Pp.     471-478.

                                defendant purposefully established                                   minimum             contacts         within        the    forum.

                              Opinion of the   Court                    471  U.  S.
arises from the alleged contractual breach.                Fla. Stat.   ยง 48.193
 (1)(g) (Supp.    1984).     The United      States   District Court      for the
 Southern District of Florida, sitting in diversity,              relied on this
provision     in  exercising personal       jurisdiction     over   a  Michigan
resident     who    allegedly    had   breached     a  franchise    agreement
 with   a Florida    corporation      by failing    to  make    required     pay-
ments     in  Florida.      The    question    presented      is whether      this
 exercise   of long-arm jurisdiction         offended    "traditional concep-
tion[s]   of  fair  play   and   substantial     justice"    embodied      in  the
 Due Process      Clause of the Fourteenth         Amendment.           Interna-

                            Opinion  of the Court                    471 U.  S.


provide that the     franchise relationship is established          in Miami
and   governed      by  Florida    law,   and   call  for  payment      of  all
required    fees   and   forwarding     of  all relevant     notices   to  the
Miami    headquarters.'        The   Miami     headquarters      sets   policy
and   works     directly    with   its  franchisees     in  attempting       to
resolve   major    problems.       See   nn.  7,  9,  infra.    Day-to-day
monitoring      of  franchisees,     however,     is  conducted      through
a network     of  10  district   offices  which    in  turn   report   to  the
Miami    headquarters.
   The   instant   litigation  grows    out  of Burger     King's   termina-
tion  of one   of  its franchisees,     and   is aptly   described    by   the
franchisee    as  "a  divorce   proceeding     among     commercial      part-
ners."     5 Record    4.   The   appellee    John   Rudzewicz,      a Michi-
gan   citizen   and  resident,    is  the  senior   partner    in  a  Detroit
accounting    firm.     In  1978,  he  was   approached      by Brian Mac-
Shara,    the   son  of  a  business    acquaintance,       who   suggested
that  they jointly    apply   to  Burger     King   for a  franchise    in the
Detroit area.       MacShara      proposed     to  serve   as the   manager
of the   restaurant    if Rudzewicz would         put  up   the  investment
capital;  in  exchange,     the  two  would    evenly share      the  profits.
Believing that MacShara's          idea offered    attractive investment
and  tax-deferral     opportunities,     Rudzewicz      agreed   to the ven-
ture.    6 id.,  at  438-439,    444,   460.
   Rudzewicz      and  MacShara jointly       applied for     a franchise    to
Burger     King's Birmingham,         Michigan,      district   office in  the
autumn     of 1978.     Their   application was forwarded to Burger
King's Miami headquarters,           which   entered    into  a preliminary
agreement      with them     in February 1979.        During the     ensuing
four   months     it was    agreed    that   Rudzewicz      and   MacShara
would    assume     operation     of  an  existing    facility   in Drayton
Plains,   Michigan.       MacShara       attended    the   prescibed     man-
agement courses in Miami          during this period,      see n.  2, supra,
and   the  franchisees     purchased     $165,000    worth    of restaurant
equipment from Burger King's             Davmor Industries        division in

                              Opinion of the    Court                     471 U.  S.


   The   Drayton Plains       facility   apparently     enjoyed     steady    busi-
ness during      the summer       of  1979,  but patronage       declined     after
a recession began        later  that   year.     Rudzewicz       and   MacShara
soon    fell  far  behind     in  their    monthly      payments       to  Miami.
Headquarters        sent   notices   of default,    and an extended period
of negotiations      began    among     the franchisees,      the Birmingham
district   office,   and   the   Miami     headquarters.          After    several
Burger     King    officials  in  Miami    had   engaged      in prolonged      but
ultimately     unsuccessful 9 negotiations with            the   franchisees      by
mail   and by     telephone,       headquarters        terminated       the   fran-
chise   and    ordered     Rudzewicz        and MacShara          to vacate     the
premises.       They refused       and continued to occupy          and operate
the  facility   as  a Burger      King   restaurant.


                                         B
   Burger     King    commenced         the  instant    action    in  the  United
States    District    Court    for  the   Southern     District    of  Florida    in
May    1981,   invoking     that   court's    diversity    jurisdiction pursu-
ant  to  28   U.  S.  C.   ยง 1332(a)   and   its  original    jurisdiction     over
federal    trademark       disputes     pursuant     to   ยง 1338(a)."      Burger
King    alleged     that   Rudzewicz        and   MacShara        had   breached
their franchise obligations         "within [the jurisdiction of] this dis-
trict   court"    by   failing   to  make     the required        payments       "at
plaintiff's   place   of business     in Miami,     Dade    County,     Florida,"
  6,  App.    121,  and   also   charged     that   they   were    tortiously    in-


  'Miami's   policy  was to  "deal directly"  with franchisees    when  they began
to encounter    financial difficulties, and  to involve   district office personnel
only  when  necessary.     5 id., at 95.   In the  instant  case, for example,   the
Miami   office handled   all credit problems,    ordered cost-cutting measures,
negotiated   for a partial refinancing of the franchisees' debts, communicated
directly  with the  franchisees  in attempting    to resolve the  dispute,  and was
responsible   for all termination matters.    See 2 id., at 59-69;  5 id., at 84-89,
94-95,   97-98,   100-103,   116-128,   151-152,    158,  163; 6  id., at  395-397,
436-438,   510-511,   524-525.

copies  of the complaint   pursuant   to Federal   Rule of Civil  Procedure    4.   2

    ' The    District     Court had      found     both that     Rudzewicz        fell  within    the reach
of Florida's       long-arm statute          and   that   the   exercise     of jurisdiction       was    con-
stitutional.        The    Court of Appeals did            not  consider the        statutory question,
however,
          "acceptedbecause,   as Burger       King acknowledged             at  argument,        that court
                the parties'      stipulation" that         ยง 48.193    reached      Rudzewicz        "in lieu
 of [making]       a  determination          of what     Florida      law   provides."         Tr.   of Oral
 Arg.    12.     Burger      King    contends      that an     appeal     is  proper     "on   the   basis   of
 the   Circuit      Court's     holding      that   given     that   stipulation the          statute     was
 unconstitutional         as applied."         Id.,   at  13 (emphasis added).

 And    with   respect     to  interstate    contractual      obligations,    we
 have    emphasized       that   parties   who    "reach out      beyond      one
 state  and   create   continuing     relationships    and   obligations with
 citizens   of another     state"   are subject    to  regulation     and   sanc-
 tions   in  the   other   State    for  the   consequences        of  their   ac-
 tivities.    Travelers Health Assn.           v. Virginia, 339      U.  S.  643,

 Co.,   355  U.   S. 220,   222-223     (1957).
    We   have    noted    several   reasons     why   a  forum    legitimately
 may    exercise personal  his jurisdiction       over   a  nonresident      who
 "purposefully      directs"        activities    toward    forum    residents.
 A   State    generally     has   a  "manifest      interest"    in   providing
 its residents     with   a  convenient      forum    for  redressing injur-
 ies  inflicted   by   out-of-state      actors.     Id.,   at  223;   see   also
 Keeton v. HustlerMagazine, Inc., supra, at 776.                    Moreover,
 where     individuals     "purposefully      derive    benefit"    from    their
 interstate     activities,   Kulko     v.  California Superior Court,


   lb"Specific" jurisdiction contrasts   with  "general" jurisdiction, pursuant
 to which  "a State exercises personal jurisdiction over a defendant in a suit
 not arising out of or  related to  the defendant's   contacts with the forum."

                             Opinion of the Court                     471  U.  S.
436  U.  S.84, 96 (1978),      it may    well  be unfair   to  allow them to
escape    having    to  account     in other    States    for  consequences
that  arise   proximately      from such     activities;   the  Due    Process
Clause    may not     readily   be  wielded     as  a territorial    shield   to
avoid   interstate     obligations     that  have    been    voluntarily     as-
sumed.      And    because    "modern     transportation      and   communi-
cations have made        it much    less  burdensome       for  a party sued
to defend     himself in    a  State   where    he   engages     in  economic
activity,"   it  usually   will  not   be  unfair   to  subject    him   to  the
burdens    of litigating in another       forum    for disputes relating to
such   activity.     McGee     v. InternationalLife         Insurance Co.,
supra, at    223.
   Notwithstanding         these    considerations,      the   constitutional
touchstone remains         whether     the   defendant     purposefully      es-
tablished    "minimum       contacts"    in the   forum    State.     Interna-
tional Shoe      Co.   v.  Washington,       supra, at      316.     Although
it has been      argued    that   foreseeability     of  causing    injury    in
another     State    should    be   sufficient    to soestablish 6 such Courtcon-
tacts there    when    policy considerations           require,'    the


has  consistently     held   that forthis kind  of foreseeability      is not   a
"sufficient    benchmark"            exercising     personal     jurisdiction.


World-Wide       Volkswagen        Corp.    v.  Woodson,       444   U.  S.,  at
295.    Instead,    "the foreseeability      that is critical    to due proc-
ess  analysis    ...   is that  the   defendant's     conduct    and   connec-
tion  with   the forum     State   are  such   that  he should    reasonably
anticipate    being haled     into  court there."      Id.,  at  297.    In  de-
fining   when    it is that   a  potential defendant        should    "reason-
ably   anticipate"    out-of-state litigation,       the  Court    frequently
has   drawn     from   the   reasoning     of  Hanson v.       Denckla,      357
U.   S.235,    253  (1958):
      "The    unilateral    activity   of  those   who    claim    some    rela-
      tionship   with   a  nonresident     defendant     cannot    satisfy   the
      requirement      of contact with     the forum     State.     The appli-

                                              Opinion of the Court                                            471 U.       S.


engaged             in    significant            activities            within         a    State,         Keeton           v.

tinuing          obligations"               between             himself           and       residents             of    the

he    manifestly             has      availed         himself of the privilege                          of conduct-
ing     business           there,        and      because          his    activities           are     shielded          by
"the       benefits         and       protections"               of the         forum's          laws       it   is   pre-
sumptively              not     unreasonable                 to    require          him to         submit         to    the
burdens           of litigation             in   that forum              as    well.
    Jurisdiction               in     these        circumstances                   may        not      be      avoided
merely          because           the      defendant              did     not      physically enter                     the
forum         State.           Although              territorial            presence            frequently             will
enhance            a   potential defendant's                         affiliation           with       a   State        and
reinforce           the reasonable foreseeability                                  of suit       there,         it is     an
inescapable              fact     of modern              commercial               life    that a        substantial
amount            of    business            is    transacted              solely         by     mail        and      wire
communications                     across         state        lines,       thus       obviating            the      need
for     physical            presence            within          a    State        in     which         business            is
conducted.

we      have         consistently               rejected            the      notion         that       an      absence
of    physical           contacts           can       defeat         personal           jurisdiction              there.

     Once        it    has been             decided            that      a    defendant              purposefully
established              minimum              contacts within                  the      forum         State,        these
contacts           may       be    considered              in light        of other          factors         to   deter-

derives from the belief that, with respect to this category of "isolated" acts,
id.,    at 297,      the reasonable foreseeability                      of litigation        in the forum is sub-

courts    in  "appropriate      case[s]"    may    evaluate    "the   burden     on
the   defendant,"       "the   forum     State's   interest    in  adjudicating
the   dispute,"    "the   plaintiff's   interest    in  obtaining     convenient
and   effective relief,"     "the interstate      judicial   system's     interest
in  obtaining     the   most    efficient    resolution    of  controversies,"
and    the  "shared     interest    of the   several    States    in  furthering
fundamental       substantive social policies."           World-Wide Volks-
wagen Corp. v.         Woodson,       444  U.   S.,  at  292.    These     consid-
erations     sometimes       serve   to  establish    the   reasonableness        of
jurisdiction     upon a    lesser   showing     of  minimum       contacts    than
would     otherwise     be   required.       See,   e. g., Keeton v. Hustler
Magazine, Inc.,          supra, at     780;   Calder v.      Jones,    supra,     at
788-789;     McGee      v. InternationalLife         Insurance Co.,        supra,
at  223-224.       On   the  other hand,      where    a defendant      who   pur-
posefully      has    directed      his   activities    at   forum      residents
seeks to      defeat   jurisdiction,      he   must    present     a  compelling
case   that    the   presence     of  some    other    considerations       would
render     jurisdiction     unreasonable.         Most such      considerations
usually    may be     accommodated         through    means short of finding
jurisdiction      unconstitutional.          For    example,      the   potential
 clash of     the   forum's     law   with    the    "fundamental        substan-
tive   social   policies"    of another     State    may    be accommodated
through     application     of the forum's     choice-of-law      rules.9     Sim-
ilarly,   a  defendant       claiming    substantial      inconvenience        may

                  BURGER       KING CORP.       v. RUDZEWICZ


462                            Opinion   of the  Court
318  U.   S.,  at  316.     Instead,    we   have emphasized          the  need    for
a "highly realistic"       approach      that  recognizes      that   a "contract"
is "ordinarily     but   an intermediate         step serving      to tie  up  prior
business     negotiations       with   future    consequences        which    them-
selves    are  the   real   object    of the   business     transaction."        Id.,
at  316-317.        It is these    factors-prior        negotiations       and   con-
templated      future     consequences,        along    with   the   terms    of  the
contract    and    the  parties'    actual    course    of dealing-that         must
be evaluated       in  determining       whether      the  defendant      purpose-
fully  established      minimum        contacts within       the   forum.
   In   this  case,   no   physical     ties  to  Florida     can be    attributed
to  Rudzewicz       other    than   MacShara's        brief training      course    in
Miami.'        Rudzewicz       did  not   maintain      offices  in  Florida     and,
for  all  that   appears     from    the   record,    has   never    even    visited
there.      Yet    this   franchise     dispute     grew directly         out   of "a
contract    which     had   a substantialconnection            with   that   State."
McGee      v.  International Life          Insurance Co.,          355    U.   S.,  at
223   (emphasis       added).       Eschewing        the   option    of  operating
an   independent          local   enterprise, andRudzewicz            deliberately
"reach[ed] out beyond"            Michigan            negotiated      with   a  Flor-


ida  corporation       for  the  purchase      of a  long-term      franchise and


   'The   Eleventh    Circuit  held   that MacShara's     presence   in Florida   was
irrelevant   to  the  question    of  Rudzewicz'    minimum     contacts   with   that
forum,   reasoning   that "Rudzewicz     and  MacShara    never formed     a partner-
ship"  and "signed    the  agreements    in their  individual capacities."     724  F.
2d,  at 1513, n.  14.   The  two did   jointly form a   corporation   through which
they  were   seeking   to conduct    the franchise,   however.     See   n. 6, supra.
They   were  required   to decide  which   one of them would     travel to Florida to
satisfy  the  training  requirements     so that  they  could  commence     business,
and  Rudzewicz participated      in the  decision that MacShara     would   go there.
We   have previously    noted   that when   commercial    activities are "carried   on
in behalf   of" an  out-of-state   party  those activities   may   sometimes    be  as-
cribed  to the  party,  InternationalShoe Co.       v. Washington, 326     U.  S. 310,
320 (1945),   at least where   he is a "primary    participan[t]"  in the  enterprise
and  has  acted   purposefully   in directing   those activities,  Calder v.   Jones,
465  U.   S., at  790.    Because    MacShara's    matriculation    at  Burger   King
University    is not pivotal to the  disposition of this  case, we need not    resolve
the  permissible   bounds   of such attribution.

a    carefully           structured             20-year          relationship              that       envisioned

old   solely    on   the   defendant's       purposeful      connection       to  the
forum.'        Nothing      in   our   cases,    however,       suggests      that    a
choice-of-law        provision      should      be   ignored      in   considering
whether      a  defendant       has   "purposefully       invoked     the   benefits
and   protections      of a  State's    laws"    for jurisdictional purposes.
Although       such    a  provision     standing      alone would be insuffi-
cient   to  confer    jurisdiction,      we   believe    that,   when     combined
with    the   20-year     interdependent         relationship      Rudzewicz es-
tablished      with    Burger      King's    Miami     headquarters,         it rein-
forced his     deliberate      affiliation   with   the   forum     State   and    the
reasonable       foreseeability        of  possible     litigation     there.      As
Judge     Johnson argued         in  his  dissent    below,     Rudzewicz       "pur-
posefully      availed    himself     of  the   benefits     and   protections       of
Florida's     laws"    by   entering     into   contracts expressly          provid-
ing   that    those    laws    would    govern      franchise     disputes.       724

    Nor    has   Rudzewicz        pointed     to  other    factors    that    can   be
said    persuasively       to  outweigh       the   considerations        discussed
above     and    to establish      the   unconstitutionality of            Florida's
assertion      of jurisdiction.        We    cannot     conclude      that   Florida
had    no   "legitimate      interest    in  holding     [Rudzewicz]        answer-

     In addition,   the  franchise   agreement's    disclaimer   that  the  "choice  of
law  designation    does  not  requirethat   all suits concerning    this Agreement
be   filed in Florida,"   App.   72  (emphasis   added),   reasonably    should   have
suggested    to  Rudzewicz    that by   negative   implication   such  suits could   be
filed there.
   The   lease also provided    for binding   arbitration  in Miami    of certain con-
demnation     disputes,   id., at 113,  and  Rudzewicz conceded        the validity  of
this  provision at  oral argument,    Tr. of Oral   Arg. 37.    Although it   doesnot
govern    the instant  dispute, this provision    also should   have made    it appar-
ent to  the franchisees   that they were    dealing directly with the Miami      head-
 quarters   and  that  the  Birmingham     district office  was  not "for  all intents
 and  purposes   the  embodiment     of Burger King."      724  F.  2d, at  1511.

                             Opinion  of the Court                    471  U. S.


for a  party    who   has   minimum      contacts    with   a forum     to  liti-
gate   there,   such   considerations       most   frequently     can be    ac-
commodated       through     a  change    of venue.      See   n.  20,  supra.
Although     the   Court    has   suggested     that   inconvenience       may
at  some    point   become      so  substantial     as  to  achieve     consti-
tutional magnitude,         McGee v.     InternationalLife         Insurance
Co.,  supra, at 223,      this  is not such    a  case.
   The   Court    of  Appeals     also  concluded,      however,     that   the
parties'    dealings     involved     "a   characteristic       disparity     of
bargaining power"        and "elements       of surprise,"    and that Rud-
zewicz    "lacked    fair  notice"   of the    potential    for  litigation   in
Florida   because     the  contractual     provisions    suggesting      to the
contrary    were    merely    "boilerplate     declarations     in  a lengthy
printed   contract."       724  F.  2d,  at  1511-1512,     and  n.  10.    See
also  post, at   489-490    (STEVENS,      J.,  dissenting).      Rudzewicz
presented     many     of  these arguments        to  the   District    Court,
contending      that   Burger     King   was    guilty   of  misrepresenta-
tion,  fraud,   and   duress;   that   it gave   insufficient notice      in its
dealings    with him; and      that the contract     was   one   of adhesion.
See   4   Record     687-691.        After    a  3-day    bench     trial,  the
District   Court    found   that   Burger    King    had  made    no  misrep-
resentations,     that   Rudzewicz       and   MacShara      "were    and   are
experienced      and    sophisticated      businessmen,"       and    that  "at
no  time"    did   they   "ac[t]   under    economic      duress    or   disad-
vantage imposed        by"  Burger King.        App.    157-158.      See also
7  Record 648-649.           Federal    Rule    of  Civil  Procedure      52(a)
requires     that   "If]indings      of  fact   shall   not    be   set   aside
unless    clearly   erroneous,"      and   neither     Rudzewicz      nor   the
Court    of Appeals     has  pointed    to  record    evidence    that   would
support     a   "definite    and     firm   conviction"      that    the   Dis-
trict  Court's   findings   are   mistaken.       United States v.     United
States    Gypsum      Co.,   333   U.   S.  364,   395   (1948).     See   also


court offered him as   much time as would be    necessary to secure the requi-
site authentication  from the   Birmingham district    office, and Burger  King
ultimately  stipulated to their authenticity rather than delay the trial.    See

462                        STEVENS,   J., dissenting


   For   the  reasons    set  forth   above,    however,     these   dangers
are   not   present    in  the   instant   case.     Because      Rudzewicz
established     a  substantial     and   continuing      relationship     with
Burger    King's    Miami headquarters,         received   fair notice from
the   contract    documents      and   the   course    of  dealing    that  he
might   be   subject   to  suit in Florida,    and   has  failed  to  demon-
strate how jurisdiction        in that forum would otherwise          be fun-
damentally unfair,       we conclude      that the    District   Court's    ex-
ercise   of  jurisdiction     pursuant     to  Fla.   Stat.   ยง 48.193(1)(g)
(Supp.    1984)   did  not  offend    due   process.     The   judgment      of
the Court     of  Appeals     is accordingly     reversed,     and   the  case
is  remanded       for  further    proceedings      consistent     with    this
opinion.
                                                          It  is so  ordered.


   JUSTICE      POWELL      took    no  part    in  the   consideration      or
decision    of this  case.


   JUSTICE      STEVENS,       with    whom     JUSTICE      WHITE      joins,
dissenting.
   In my opinion there       is a significant    element of unfairness       in
requiring     a franchisee     to defend     a  case   of this   kind   in the
forum    chosen by the franchisor.          It is undisputed     that   appel-
lee maintained      no  place  of business    in Florida,    that he   had   no
employees      in that   State,   and  that   he  was   not licensed     to do
business    there.     Appellee     did  not prepare     his  French     fries,
shakes,    and  hamburgers       in  Michigan,     and  then   deliver   them
into the   stream    of commerce       "with   the  expectation     that they
[would]    be  purchased      by   consumers     in"   Florida.     Ante,    at
473.    To   the   contrary,    appellee    did  business    only   in  Michi-
gan,   his  business,    property,    and   payroll   taxes   were   payable
in that   State,   and  he   sold all  of his  products    there.
   Throughout       the  business    relationship,    appellee's    principal
contacts    with   appellant were with        its Michigan     office.    Not-
withstanding       its disclaimer,     ante,   at  478,  the Court      seems
ultimately     to  rely   on   nothing    more     than   standard     boiler-
plate   language    contained    in  various documents,        ante, at 481,

to establish that appellee       "'purposefully     availed   himself of the
benefits    and  protections     of Florida's laws."'         Ante,    at 482.
Such superficial     analysis   creates a potential      for unfairness     not
only   in negotiations      between     franchisors     and   their   franchi-
sees  but,   more   significantly,    in the  resolution    of the disputes
that inevitably     arise   from time to time       in such   relationships.
   Judge    Vance's     opinion    for  the   Court   of  Appeals     for   the
Eleventh     Circuit   adequately     explains    why   I would affirm      the
judgment      of  that   court.     I  particularly     find  the   following
more   persuasive      than  what this     Court has     written    today:
         "Nothing     in the course of negotiations        gave   Rudzewicz
      reason to anticipate      a Burger     King   suit  outside   of Michi-
      gan.    The    only  face-to-face    or even    oral  contact    Rudze-
      wicz   had   with   Burger    King    throughout      months     of pro-
      tracted    negotiations      was    with   representatives        of  the
      Michigan     office.    Burger     King   had   the   Michigan     office
      interview     Rudzewicz      and   MacShara,      appraise    their   ap-
      plication, discuss     price terms,     recommend       the site  which
      the   defendants      finally  agreed    to,   and   attend the      final
      closing   ceremony.       There    is no evidence     that Rudzewicz
      ever   negotiated     with  anyone     in Miami    or  even   sent  mail
      there   during     negotiations.       He   maintained      no  staff   in
      the  state of Florida,      and  as far  as the   record   reveals,    he
      has   never even     visited   the  state.the
         "The    contracts     contemplated             startup    of  a  local
      Michigan     restaurant     whose     profits   would    derive    solely
      from    food   sales  made    to  customers      in  Drayton     Plains.
      The sale,    which    involved    the  use  of an   intangible    trade-
      mark     in  Michigan      and   occupancy       of  a  Burger      King
      facility  there,    required    no   performance      in  the   state   of
      Florida.      Under the       contract,    the   local  Michigan     dis-
      trict  office was    responsible for providing         all of the serv-
      ices  due   Rudzewicz,      including    advertising     and   manage-
      ment    consultation.        Supervision,      moreover,      emanated
      from    that   office  alone.      To   Rudzewicz,      the   Michigan
      office  was   for  all intents    and   purposes     the  embodiment
                BURGER       KING CORP.     v. RUDZEWICZ


462                        STEVENS,   J., dissenting


     of  Burger      King.      He had      reason    to  believe    that   his
     working relationship with          Burger     King began      and  ended
     in Michigan,      not   at  the  distant   and anonymous         Florida
     headquarters....
        "Given     that  the   office  in  Rudzewicz'     home     state  con-
     ducted    all of the   negotiations     and   wholly    supervised     the
     contract,    we   believe    that  he  had   reason    to  assume    that
     the   state   of  the   supervisory      office  would    be   the  same
      state in which     Burger     King   would    file suit.    Rudzewicz
     lacked    fair  notice   that   the  distant    corporate headquar-
     ters   which   insulated    itself from    direct   dealings   with   him
     would     later  seek   to  assert   jurisdiction     over   him in    the
     courts    of its own    home    state....
        "Just as    Rudzewicz lacked         notice   of the   possibility    of
      suit  in  Florida,    he  was    financially   unprepared      to   meet
     its  added    costs.    The franchise     relationship     in particular
      is fraught     with   potential    for   financial   surprise.       The
      device   of  the   franchise    gives   local   retailers   the   access
      to national     trademark      recognition     which    enables    them
      to  compete      with   better-financed,       more    efficient   chain
      stores.    This national     affiliation,  however,     does not alter
      the fact that the typical      franchise    store is   a local concern
      serving   at best   a  neighborhood       or community.         Neither
      the  revenues      of  a  local  business     nor   the  geographical
      range    of  its   market     prepares      the   average     franchise
      owner    for  the  cost  of distant   litigation.   ...
         "The   particular distribution of bargaining           power in the
      franchise    relationship     further    impairs     the   franchisee's
      financial   preparedness.         In   a  franchise     contract,    'the
      franchisor    normally     occupies     [the]  dominant role'.       . ..
         "We    discern    a  characteristic     disparity    of  bargaining
      power    in  the  facts  of this   case.     There    is no  indication
      that  Rudzewicz had        any   latitude   to negotiate     a reduced
      rent  or  franchise     fee in  exchange      for  the  added    risk   of
      suit  in  Florida.      He signed       a standard      form   contract
      whose    terms    were    non-negotiable       and   which    appeared

to subject appellant to a suit to recover it.            The   activities which establish
its "presence"      subject    it alike to taxation by         the   state  and    to  suit  to

California    that same month, she and petitioner agreed that                she would file
for divorce on grounds of "irreconcilable differences."
      In October 1987, petitioner filed for divorce           in New Jersey state court
on grounds of "desertion." Petitioner did not, however, obtain an issuance
of  summons against his           wife   and   did not     attempt     to serve    her   with
process. Mrs. Burnham, after unsuccessfully demanding                       that  petitioner
adhere    to  their   prior agreement to submit to            an   "irreconcilable     differ-
ences" divorce, brought suit for divorce in California state court in early
January 1988.
      In  late  January,     petitioner visited     southern     California on business,
after which he went north           to visit his children in the San Francisco Bay
area, where his wife resided. He took the older child to San Francisco for
the   weekend.      Upon    returning     the   child   to  Mrs.   Burnham's       home     on
January 24, 1988, petitioner was served with a California court summons
and   a copy of Mrs.      Burnham's divorce petition. He           then   returned to New
Jersey.
      Later that year, petitioner made a special appearance in the California
Superior Court, moving to quash the service of process on                  the ground that
the court lacked personal jurisdiction over him because his only contacts
with California were a         few   short   visits to  the   State   for the purposes of
conducting business and visiting his children.              The Superior Court denied
 the  motion,    and   the  California   Court of Appeal denied mandamus relief,
rejecting petitioner's contention          that   the  Due   Process    Clause prohibited
California courts from asserting jurisdiction over him because to behe "alacked
 "minimum       contacts"    with the     State.   The court held       it               valid
jurisdictional predicate for in personam jurisdiction"                that the   "defendant
 [was]   present    in  the forum     state   and   personally     served   with   process."

 over       Burnham-returned-to-New-Jersey-without-service-which                                                                  we       know
 does not conform with "contemporary                                          notions of due               process."
         There          is,    we      must         acknowledge,                 one factor              mentioned               by Justice
 Brennan that                 both      relates distinctively to                       the     assertion           of jurisdiction on
 the     basis of personal in-state service                                 and      is fully persuasive-namely,                               the
fact       that      a    defendant              voluntarily present                       in a       particular             State        has      a
 "reasonable               expectatio[n]"                 that       he      is    subject to             suit      there. makes* that* *       By
 formulating              it  as a      "reasonable               expectation" Justice Brennan
 seem like           a   "fairness" factor;                   but in         reality, of course,                  it  is just tradition
 masquerading as                    "fairness." The                   only reason for charging Mr.                                 Burnham
 with      the reasonable expectation                              of being subject to                   suit is        that the States
 of the        Union          assert        adjudicatory jurisdiction over                                the      person,         and       have
 always asserted adjudicatory jurisdiction over                                                the     person, by serving him
 with process                during         his temporary physical presence in                                          their      territory.
 That continuing tradition, which anyone                                             entering           California            should have
 known about, renders                         it   "fair"       for Mr. Burnham, who voluntarily entered
 California, to be sued                          there        for     divorce--at             least       "fair"         in    the      limited
 sense        that      he has no one                   but      himself to blame.                    Justice          Brennan's              long
 journey is a circular one, leaving him,                                        at the end of the day, in complete
 reliance upon                  the      very factor              he sought to                  avoid:         The       existence            of    a
 continuing tradition                        is    not      enough,            fairness          also       must        be     considered;
 fairness exists here because there is a continuing tradition.

        In  this    case,    it  is undisputed           that    petitioner was served with process
while voluntarily              and     knowingly in            the    State     of California. I therefore
 concur in       the judgment.
        JusTICE STEVENS,           concurring in the judgment.
        As    I explained in my separate writing, I did                                 not    join    the    Court's
 opinion       in    Shaffer       v.   Heitner        *   *  *  because         I   was     concerned          by    its
 unnecessarily broad reach.                     * *or *Justice The same concern prevents me from
joining either           Justice      Scalia's                        Brennan's         opinion in this case.
 For me,       it is sufficient to note             that    the    historical evidence             and    consensus
 identified by Justice               Scalia,     the     considerations of fairness identified by
 Justice Brennan,              and    the    common sense displayed by                       Justice      White, all
 combine        to  demonstrate that              this   is, indeed, a very easy case.*                  According-
 ly, I agree      that    the judgment should be affirmed.

 tions were printed on the pass:                                                    "In                                            of the issuance of this

            Plaintiff in                  her  of its tracks and original complaint charged defendant with negligence
 in the           maintenance                                                                  the operation of its train.                                      Mter a pre-
 trial conference,                             at      which             the        legal effect                   of       the       release from                        liability
 contained in the                            pass was discussed, plaintiff filed                                                    an      amended complaint
 charging defendant with wilful or wanton conduct.
            On        the basis of the amended pleadings                                                         and         supporting affidavits filed
 by defendant, defendant moved for summary judgment                                                                                                    under             Rule 56

            It     is undisputed that                              the        derailment                   was         caused by a break in one                                         of
 the        rails as               the        train          was passing over                                the        track.           It      is also shown by
 defendant's affidavits, and                                           not        denied, that                    the        break           in     the       rail was due
 to a transverse fissure inside                                                 the        cap of            the        rail, which broke vertically
 under             the         weight of                  the         train;          that          such a fissure is                              not        visible upon
 inspection;                   that         such defects occur in both new                                                    and         old rails; and                      that        a
 visual inspection was in fact made of this particular rail                                                                                      the day preceding
 the        accident and the defect was not discovered.
             Since           plaintiff was                       an       intrastate                  passenger, and since                                    the        accident
  occurred in West Virginia, the law of West Virginia governs both the effect
  to be given                    to *the           release             and         the       degree             of care which defendant owed
  plaintiff.             * *

  and          the         Court             has        not         found,              any         West Virginia                           decision               which             has
  determined the effect which a release from liability contained in a pass has
  upon the carrier's duty to the holder of such a pass.                                                                              *     *     *

one who accepts a free pass                    * *    *;  but    that    for reasons        of public policy           it
cannot relieve itself of liability for wilful or wanton acts.                               *   *   *
       I  am     therefore        of    [the]    opinion        that    the     sole duty         imposed upon
defendant         under      the    facts     of   this case        was     to refrain from wilfully                  or
wantonly injuring plaintiff.
       In Kelly       v.  Checker White Cab, Inc., 131                       W.Va.      816    at   page 822;         50
S.E.2d 888 at          page 892,        the   West Virginia court, quoting from 29                          Cyc. 510
said:
       "In    order that        one may be held guilty of wilful                      or wanton conduct,               it
must     be shown         that    he   was     conscious       of his conduct,          and     conscious, from
his knowledge           of existing conditions,               that    injury would likely             or probably
result     from      his    conduct,       and      that    with      reckless       indifference to            conse-
quences he consciously and intentionally did some wrongful act or omitted
some known duty which produced the injurious result.                                      * *    *"
       The substance of plaintiff's contention                         that defendant wilfully injured
her is that       defendant used old               and    obsolescent rails in its tracks, knowing
that     the   use     of   these rails made derailments reasonably probable.                                     It   is
charged       that defendant used old rails because                          the   cost    of derailments was
less    than     the cost        of   replacing the old rails,                 and      that    for this reason
defendant was willing to take the risk of derailments.
       I am of opinion              that    the    complaint fails to             state     sufficient facts to
substantiate a charge of wilfulness, as                           that    term      is defined        by   the    West
Virginia court.           It is clear      that    plaintiff has         stated     a charge of negligence;
but    that     is not     the    test   in this case. To establish wilfulness                         it  would be
necessary to charge               that     defendant knew              of this particular defect in the
rail;   that the      defect would probably result in a break in the rail if the                                  train
were     run     over it, causing a derailment                     of the     train;     and     that    defendant,
with this knowledge               of existing conditions, and the                    likelihood or         probabili-
ty of an      injury resulting from its conduct, intentionally drove its train over
the    defective rail with an indifference to                        the   consequences.           The     undenied
affidavits of defendant show clearly                         that     plaintiff cannot establish these
facts.
       At     the    hearing       of    this    motion,        counsel       for    plaintiff moved             for    a
continuance           of   the    hearing to enable him to                     substantiate          a newspaper
report to       the    effect    that    defendant was using old                   and    obsolescent rails in
its   tracks because            the    cost    of derailments was cheaper                      than     the    cost    of
replacing the          rails. The motion was denied since this contention, even if it
were true, merely has a bearing on                           an   issue     of negligence,          and    not upon
the    question        of wilful conduct. Plaintiff does                       not    contend        that    she can
establish       that     defendant knew               of   the particular defect               in    the    rail   that
caused the derailment.
        For    the reasons         stated     above, defendant's motion for                      summary judg-             I
ment      will be sustained.           *   *  *
Rule 56.     Summary Judgment
     (a) Motion       for   Summary        Judgment        or   Partial    Summary
Judgment.      A party    may move for summary judgment, identifying each
claim   or  defense-or      the   part   of each    claim    or  defense-on      which
summary judgment is sought.           The   court shall grant summary judgment
 if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute              as to any material
 fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. The court
should    state  on   the  record    the  reasons for     granting    or denying     the
 motion.                                                                                   . .
      (b) Time to File a Motion. Unless a different time is set by local
 rule  or   the  court   orders   otherwise,     a  party   may    file  a  motion    for
 summary     judgment     at   any  time   until   30  days   after   the  close   of all
 discovery.

certiorari to the court of appeals of north carolina


        No. 10–76.      Argued January 11, 2011—Decided June 27, 2011


Respondents, North Carolina residents whose sons died in a bus accident
   outside Paris, France,  led a suit for wrongful-death damages in North
   Carolina state court.         Alleging that the accident was caused by tire
   failure, they named as defendants Goodyear USA, an Ohio corporation,
   and petitioners, three Goodyear USA subsidiaries, organized and oper
   ating, respectively, in Luxembourg, Turkey, and France.                     Petitioners’
   tires are manufactured primarily for European and Asian markets and
   differ in size and construction from tires ordinarily sold in the United
   States.    Petitioners are not registered to do business in North Carolina;
   have no place of business, employees, or bank accounts in the State; do
   not design, manufacture, or advertise their products in the State; and
   do not solicit business in the State or sell or ship tires to North Carolina
   customers.      Even so, a small percentage of their tires were distributed
   in North Carolina by other Goodyear USA af liates.                     The trial court
   denied petitioners’ motion to dismiss the claims against them for want of
   personal jurisdiction.       The North Carolina Court of Appeals af rmed,
   concluding that the North Carolina courts had general jurisdiction over
   petitioners, whose tires had reached the State through “the stream of
   commerce.”
Held:   Petitioners     were    not   amenable      to   suit  in   North    Carolina     on
   claims unrelated to any activity of petitioners in the forum State.

      (a) The Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause sets the outer
   boundaries of a state tribunal’s authority to proceed against a defendant.
   The pathmarking decision of International Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326
   U. S. 310, provides that state courts may exercise personal jurisdiction
   over an out-of-state defendant who has “certain minimum contacts with
   [the State] such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend ‘tradi
   tional notions of fair play and substantial justice.’ ”              Id., at 316.    En
   deavoring to give speci c content to the “fair play and substantial jus
   tice” concept, the Court in International Shoe classi ed cases involving
   out-of-state corporate defendants.           First, the Court recognized that ju

   acts” in a State may be suf cient to render a corporation answerable in
   that State with respect to those acts, though not with respect to matters
   unrelated to the forum connections.              Id., at 318.     These two categories
   compose what is now known as “speci c jurisdiction.”                         Helicopteros

   national Shoe distinguished from cases that  t within the “speci c juris
   diction” categories, “instances in which the continuous corporate opera
   tions within a state [are] so substantial and of such a nature as to justify
   suit against it on causes of action arising from dealings entirely distinct
   from those activities.”          326 U. S., at 318.        Adjudicatory authority so
   grounded is now called “general jurisdiction.”                 Helicopteros, 466 U. S.,
   at 414, n. 9.    Since International Shoe, this Court’s decisions have elab
   orated primarily on circumstances that warrant the exercise of speci c
   jurisdiction.      In only two decisions postdating International Shoe                   has
   this Court considered whether an out-of-state corporate defendant’s in
   state contacts were suf ciently “continuous and systematic” to justify
   the exercise of general jurisdiction over claims unrelated to those con
   tacts: Perkins      v. Benguet Consol.        Mining     Co., 342 U. S. 437; and       Heli
   copteros, 466 U. S. 408.         Pp. 923–925.
      (b)  Petitioners lack “the kind of continuous and systematic general
   business contacts” necessary to allow North Carolina to entertain a suit
   against them unrelated to anything that connects them to the State.
   Helicopteros, 466 U. S., at 416.          The stream-of-commerce cases on which
   the North Carolina court relied relate to exercises of speci c jurisdiction
   in products liability actions, in which a nonresident defendant, acting
   outside    the forum, places in the stream of commerce a product that
   ultimately causes harm inside             the forum.      Many state long-arm stat
   utes authorize courts to exercise speci c jurisdiction over manufactur
   ers when the events in suit, or some of them, occurred within the forum
   State.    The North Carolina court’s stream-of-commerce analysis elided
   the essential difference between case-speci c and general jurisdiction.
   Flow of a manufacturer’s products into the forum may bolster an af lia
   tion germane to speci c jurisdiction, see, e. g., World-Wide Volkswagen
   Corp.    v. Woodson,      444 U. S. 286, 297; but ties serving to bolster the
   exercise of speci c jurisdiction do not warrant a determination that,
   based on those ties, the forum has general jurisdiction over a defendant.
   A corporation’s “continuous activity of some sorts within a state,” Inter
   national     Shoe   instructed, “is not enough to support the demand that
   the corporation be amenable to suits unrelated to that activity.”                        326

      Measured against       Helicopteros and Perkins, North Carolina is not a
   forum in which it would be permissible to subject petitioners to general
   jurisdiction.     In the 1952 Perkins case, general jurisdiction was appro
   priately exercised over a Philippine corporation sued in Ohio, where the
   company’s affairs were overseen during World War II.                  In Helicopteros,
   however, the survivors of U. S. citizens killed when a helicopter owned
   by   a  Colombian       corporation     crashed    in   Peru    could    not   maintain
   wrongful-death actions against that corporation in Texas, where the
   company’s contacts “consisted of sending its chief executive of cer to
   Houston for a contract-negotiation session; accepting into its New York
   bank account checks drawn on a Houston bank; purchasing helicopters,
   equipment, and training services from [a Texas enterprise]; and sending
   personnel to [Texas] for training.”            466 U. S., at 416.      These links to
   Texas did not “constitute the kind of continuous and systematic general
   business contacts . . . found to exist in Perkins,” and were insuf cient
   to support the exercise of jurisdiction over a claim that neither “ ‘ar[o]se
   out   of ’ . .  .  no[r]  related    to”  the   defendant’s     activities    in  Texas.
   Id., at 415–416.       This Court sees no reason to differentiate from the
   ties to Texas held insuf cient in           Helicopteros,     the sales of petition
   ers’ tires sporadically made in North Carolina through intermediaries.
   Pp. 926–929.
      (c) Neither below nor in their brief in opposition to the petition for
   certiorari did respondents urge disregard of petitioners’ discrete status
   as subsidiaries and treatment of all Goodyear entities as a “unitary busi
   ness,” so that jurisdiction over the parent would draw in the subsid
   iaries as well.     Respondents have therefore forfeited this contention.

   Justice Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the Court.
   This case concerns the jurisdiction of state courts over cor
porations organized and operating abroad.                   We address, in
particular, this question: Are foreign subsidiaries of a United
States parent corporation amenable to suit in state court on
claims unrelated to any activity of the subsidiaries in the
forum State?
   A bus accident outside Paris that took the lives of two
13-year-old boys from North Carolina gave rise to the liti
gation we here consider.            Attributing the accident to a de
fective tire manufactured in Turkey at the plant of a foreign
subsidiary      of  The    Goodyear      Tire    and    Rubber      Company
(Goodyear USA), the boys’ parents commenced an action for
damages in a North Carolina state court; they named as de
fendants Goodyear USA, an Ohio corporation, and three of
its  subsidiaries, organized          and   operating,     respectively,      in
Turkey, France, and Luxembourg.                   Goodyear USA, which
had plants in North Carolina and regularly engaged in com
mercial activity there, did not contest the North Carolina
court’s jurisdiction over it; Goodyear USA’s foreign subsidi
aries, however, maintained that North Carolina lacked adju
dicatory authority over them.
   A state court’s assertion of jurisdiction exposes defendants
to the State’s coercive power, and is therefore subject to re
view for compatibility with the Fourteenth Amendment’s
Due Process Clause.            International       Shoe    Co.  v. Washing

tions of fair play and substantial justice’ ” (quoting Milliken

   A   court    may     assert    general    jurisdiction     over    foreign
(sister-state or foreign-country) corporations to hear any and
all claims against them when their af liations with the State
are so “continuous and systematic” as to render them essen
tially at home in the forum State.              See International Shoe,
326 U. S., at 317.        Speci c jurisdiction, on the other hand,
depends on an “af liatio[n] between the forum and the under
lying controversy,” principally, activity or an occurrence that
takes place in the forum State and is therefore subject to the
State’s regulation.         von Mehren & Trautman, Jurisdiction
To Adjudicate: A Suggested Analysis, 79 Harv. L. Rev. 1121,
1136 (1966) (hereinafter von Mehren & Trautman); see Bril
mayer et al., A General Look at General Jurisdiction, 66
Texas L. Rev. 721, 782 (1988) (hereinafter Brilmayer).                       In
contrast to general, all-purpose jurisdiction, speci c jurisdic
tion is con ned to adjudication of “issues deriving from, or
connected with, the very controversy that establishes juris
diction.”     von Mehren & Trautman 1136.
   Because the episode-in-suit, the bus accident, occurred in
France, and the tire alleged to have caused the accident was
manufactured and sold abroad, North Carolina courts lacked
specific jurisdiction to adjudicate the controversy.                      The
North Carolina Court of Appeals so acknowledged.                       Brown
v.  Meter,   199 N. C. App. 50, 57–58, 681 S. E. 2d 382, 388

to general jurisdiction in North Carolina courts?                 Confusing

                            Opinion of the Court


North Carolina courts answered yes.                   Some of the tires
made abroad by Goodyear’s foreign subsidiaries, the North
Carolina Court of Appeals stressed, had reached North Caro
lina through “the stream of commerce”; that connection, the
Court of Appeals believed, gave North Carolina courts the
handle needed for the exercise of general jurisdiction over
the foreign corporations.           Id.,  at 67–68, 681 S. E. 2d, at
394–395.
   A connection so limited between the forum and the for
eign corporation, we hold, is an inadequate basis for the exer
cise of general jurisdiction.         Such a connection does not es
tablish the “continuous and systematic” af liation necessary
to empower North Carolina courts to entertain claims unre
lated to the foreign corporation’s contacts with the State.


                                      I
   On April 18, 2004, a bus destined for Charles de Gaulle
Airport overturned on a road outside Paris, France.                     Pas
sengers on the bus were young soccer players from North
Carolina beginning their journey home.                 Two 13-year-olds,
Julian Brown and Matthew Helms, sustained fatal injuries.
The boys’ parents, respondents in this Court,  led a suit for
wrongful-death damages in the Superior Court of Onslow
County, North Carolina, in their capacity as administrators
of the boys’ estates.        Attributing the accident to a tire that
failed when its plies separated, the parents alleged negli
gence in the “design, construction, testing, and inspection” of
the tire.    199 N. C. App., at 51, 681 S. E. 2d, at 384 (internal

   Goodyear Luxembourg Tires, SA (Goodyear Luxembourg),

ture tires primarily for sale in European and Asian mar
kets.    Their tires differ in size and construction from tires
ordinarily sold in the United States.                They are designed to
carry signi cantly heavier loads, and to serve under road
conditions and speed limits in the manufacturers’ primary
markets.1
   In contrast to the parent company, Goodyear USA, which
does not contest the North Carolina courts’ personal jurisdic
tion over it, petitioners are not registered to do business in
North Carolina.         They have no place of business, employees,
or bank accounts in North Carolina.                   They do not design,
manufacture, or advertise their products in North Carolina.
And they do not solicit business in North Carolina or them
selves sell or ship tires to North Carolina customers.                     Even
so, a small percentage of petitioners’ tires (tens of thousands
out of tens of millions manufactured between 2004 and 2007)
were distributed within North Carolina by other Goodyear
USA af liates.         These tires were typically custom ordered
to equip specialized vehicles such as cement mixers, waste
haulers,     and    boat   and    horse     trailers.    Petitioners      state,
and respondents do not here deny, that the type of tire in
volved in the accident, a Goodyear Regional RHS tire manu
factured     by   Goodyear       Turkey,     was     never    distributed      in
North Carolina.
   Petitioners moved to dismiss the claims against them for
want of personal jurisdiction.              The trial court denied the
motion, and the North Carolina Court of Appeals af rmed.
Acknowledging that the claims neither “related to, nor . . .
ar[o]se from, [petitioners’] contacts with North Carolina,” the
Court of Appeals con ned its analysis to “general rather


   1 Respondents portray Goodyear USA’s structure as a reprehensible ef
fort to “outsource” all manufacturing, and correspondingly, tort litigation,
to foreign jurisdictions.    See Brief for Respondents 51–53.       Yet Turkey,
where the tire alleged to have caused the accident-in-suit was made, is
hardly a strange location for a facility that primarily supplies markets in
Europe and Asia.

than speci c jurisdiction,” which the court recognized re

“continuous and systematic contacts” with the forum.                        Id.,
at 58, 681 S. E. 2d, at 388 (internal quotation marks omitted).
That threshold was crossed, the court determined, when
petitioners placed their tires “in the stream of interstate
commerce without any limitation on the extent to which
those tires could be sold in North Carolina.”                 Id., at 67, 681
S. E. 2d, at 394.
   Nothing in the record, the court observed, indicated that
petitioners “took any af rmative action to cause tires which
they had manufactured to be shipped into North Carolina.”
Id., at 64, 681 S. E. 2d, at 392.            The court found, however,
that tires made by petitioners reached North Carolina as a
consequence of a “highly-organized distribution process” in
volving other Goodyear USA subsidiaries.                     Id.,  at 67, 681
S. E. 2d, at 394.       Petitioners, the court noted, made “no at
tempt to keep these tires from reaching the North Carolina
market.”      Id., at 66, 681 S. E. 2d, at 393.           Indeed, the very
tire involved in the accident, the court observed, conformed
to tire standards established by the U. S. Department of
Transportation and bore markings required for sale in the
United States.        Ibid.2     As further support, the court in
voked North Carolina’s “interest in providing a forum in
which its citizens are able to seek redress for [their] inju
ries,” and noted the hardship North Carolina plaintiffs would
experience “[were they] required to litigate their claims in
France,” a country to which they have no ties.                     Id.,  at 68,
681 S. E. 2d, at 394.          The North Carolina Supreme Court


  2 Such markings do not necessarily show that any of the tires were des
tined for sale in the United States.    To facilitate trade, the Solicitor Gen
eral explained, the United States encourages other countries to “treat
compliance   with   [Department    of  Transportation]    standards,  including
through use of DOT markings, as evidence that the products are safely
manufactured.”     Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 32.

                                       A
   The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment
sets the outer boundaries of a state tribunal’s authority to
proceed against a defendant.             Shaffer v. Heitner,        433 U. S.
186, 207 (1977).       The canonical opinion in this area remains
International       Shoe, 326 U. S. 310, in which we held that a
State may authorize its courts to exercise personal jurisdic
tion over an out-of-state defendant if the defendant has “cer
tain minimum contacts with [the State] such that the mainte
nance of the suit does not offend ‘traditional notions of fair
play and substantial justice.’ ”           Id., at 316 (quoting       Meyer,
311 U. S., at 463).
   Endeavoring to give speci c content to the “fair play and
substantial justice” concept, the Court in International Shoe
classi ed cases involving out-of-state corporate defendants.
First, as in     International       Shoe   itself, jurisdiction unques
tionably could be asserted where the corporation’s in-state
activity is “continuous and systematic” and                   that   activity
gave rise to the episode-in-suit.           326 U. S., at 317.      Further,
the Court observed, the commission of certain “single or oc
casional acts” in a State may be suf cient to render a corpo
ration answerable in that State with respect to those acts,
though not with respect to matters unrelated to the forum
connections.       Id., at 318.     The heading courts today use to
encompass these two International Shoe categories is “spe
ci c jurisdiction.”       See von Mehren & Trautman 1144–1163.

forum.”     Helicopteros, 466 U. S., at 414, n. 8.
  International         Shoe distinguished from cases that fit
within the “speci c jurisdiction” categories, “instances in
which the continuous corporate operations within a state
[are] so substantial and of such a nature as to justify suit
against it on causes of action arising from dealings entirely
distinct from those activities.”            326 U. S.,     at 318.     Adju
dicatory authority so grounded is today called “general ju
risdiction.”     Helicopteros,     466 U. S., at 414, n. 9.          For an
individual, the paradigm forum for the exercise of general
jurisdiction is the individual’s domicile; for a corporation,
it is an equivalent place, one in which the corporation is
fairly regarded as at home.             See Brilmayer 728 (identify
ing domicile, place of incorporation, and principal place of
business as “paradig[m]” bases for the exercise of general
jurisdiction).
  Since International Shoe, this Court’s decisions have elab
orated primarily on circumstances that warrant the exercise
of speci c jurisdiction, particularly in cases involving “single
or occasional acts” occurring or having their impact within
the forum State.        As a rule in these cases, this Court has
inquired whether there was “some act by which the defend
ant purposefully avail[ed] itself of the privilege of conduct
ing activities within the forum State, thus invoking the bene
 ts and protections of its laws.”             Hanson     v.  Denckla,     357
U. S. 235, 253 (1958).         See,   e. g., World-Wide       Volkswagen
Corp.   v. Woodson, 444 U. S. 286, 287, 297 (1980) (Oklahoma
court may not exercise personal jurisdiction “over a nonresi
dent automobile retailer          and    its  wholesale     distributor     in
a products-liability action, when the defendants’ only con
nection with Oklahoma is the fact that an automobile sold in
New York to New York residents became involved in an acci
dent in Oklahoma”);        Burger     King    Corp.   v.  Rudzewicz,      471

ness . . . that the components it manufactured, sold, and de

California court’s adjudication of Taiwanese company’s
cross-complaint);      id., at 109 (opinion of O’Connor, J.); id., at
116–117 (Brennan, J., concurring in part and concurring in

diction, 101 Harv. L. Rev. 610, 628 (1988) (in the wake of
International       Shoe,   “speci c jurisdiction has become the
centerpiece of modern jurisdiction theory, while general ju
risdiction plays a reduced role”).
   In only two decisions postdating International Shoe, dis
cussed infra, at 927–929, has this Court considered whether
an out-of-state corporate defendant’s in-state contacts were
suf ciently “continuous and systematic” to justify the exer
cise of general jurisdiction over claims unrelated to those
contacts: Perkins v.       Benguet     Consol. Mining        Co., 342 U. S.
437 (1952) (general jurisdiction appropriately exercised over
Philippine corporation sued in Ohio, where the company’s
affairs were overseen during World War II); and                    Helicop
teros, 466 U. S. 408 (helicopter owned by Colombian corpora
tion crashed in Peru; survivors of U. S. citizens who died in
the crash, the Court held, could not maintain wrongful-death
actions against the Colombian corporation in Texas, for the
corporation’s helicopter purchases and purchase-linked activ
ity in Texas were insuf cient to subject it to Texas court’s
general jurisdiction).

                                  v. BROWN
                             Opinion of the Court


                                       B
   To justify the exercise of general jurisdiction over peti
tioners, the North Carolina courts relied on the petitioners’
placement of their tires in the “stream of commerce.”                       See
supra,    at 921–923.       The stream-of-commerce metaphor has
been invoked frequently in lower court decisions permitting
“jurisdiction in products liability cases in which the product
has traveled through an extensive chain of distribution be
fore reaching the ultimate consumer.”                 18 W. Fletcher, Cy
clopedia of the Law of Corporations § 8640.40, p. 133 (rev.
ed. 2007).      Typically, in such cases, a nonresident defendant,
acting outside the forum, places in the stream of commerce a
product that ultimately causes harm inside the forum.                       See
generally Dayton, Personal Jurisdiction and the Stream of
Commerce, 7 Rev. Litigation 239, 262–268 (1988) (discussing
origins and evolution of the stream-of-commerce doctrine).
   Many States have enacted long-arm statutes authorizing
courts to exercise speci c jurisdiction over manufacturers
when the events in suit, or some of them, occurred within
the forum state.         For example, the “Local Injury; Foreign
Act” subsection of North Carolina’s long-arm statute author
izes North Carolina courts to exercise personal jurisdiction
in “any action claiming injury to person or property within
this State arising out of [the defendant’s] act or omission out
side this State,” if, “in addition[,] at or about the time of the
injury,” “[p]roducts . . . manufactured by the defendant were
used or consumed, within this State in the ordinary course3
of trade.”      N. C. Gen. Stat. Ann. § 1–75.4(4)(b) (Lexis 2009).
As the North Carolina Court of Appeals recognized, this pro
vision of the State’s long-arm statute “does not apply to this
case,” for both the act alleged to have caused injury (the
fabrication of the allegedly defective tire) and its impact (the
  3 Cf. D. C. Code § 13–423(a)(4) (2001) (providing for speci c jurisdiction
over defendant who “caus[es] tortious injury in the [forum] by an act or
omission outside the [forum]” when, in addition, the defendant “derives
substantial revenue from goods used or consumed . . . in the [forum]”).

accident) occurred outside the forum.                   See 199 N. C. App.,
at 61, n. 6, 681 S. E. 2d, at 390, n. 6.4
   The North Carolina court’s stream-of-commerce analysis
elided the essential difference between case-speci c and                       all-
purpose (general) jurisdiction.               Flow of a manufacturer’s
products into the forum, we have explained, may bolster
an   af liation     germane       to  speci c     jurisdiction.       See,   e. g.,
World-Wide       Volkswagen,        444 U. S., at 297 (where “the sale
of a product . . . is not simply an isolated occurrence, but
arises from the efforts of the manufacturer or distributor to
serve . . . the market for its product in [several] States, it is
not unreasonable to subject it to suit in one of those States
if its allegedly defective merchandise                  has    there   been    the
source of injury to its owner or to others” (emphasis added)).
But ties serving to bolster the exercise of speci c jurisdiction
do not warrant a determination that, based on those ties, the
forum has      general    jurisdiction over a defendant.               See,  e. g.,
Stabilisierungsfonds          Fur    Wein     v. Kaiser     Stuhl    Wine    Dis
tributors     Pty.   Ltd.,   647 F. 2d 200, 203, n. 5 (CADC 1981)
(defendants’ marketing arrangements, although “adequate to
permit litigation of claims relating to [their] introduction of
. . . wine into the United States stream of commerce, . . .
would not be adequate to support general, ‘all purpose’ adju
dicatory authority”).
   A corporation’s “continuous activity of some sorts within
a state,”    International Shoe           instructed, “is not enough to
support the demand that the corporation be amenable to
suits unrelated to that activity.”                326 U. S., at 318.          Our
  4 The court instead relied on N. C. Gen. Stat. Ann. § 1–75.4(1)(d), see 199
N. C. App., at 57, 681 S. E. 2d, at 388, which provides for jurisdiction,
“whether the claim arises within or without [the] State,” when the defend
ant “[i]s engaged in substantial activity within this State, whether such
activity is wholly interstate, intrastate, or otherwise.”         This provision,
the North Carolina Supreme Court has held, was “intended to make avail
able to the North Carolina courts the full jurisdictional powers permissible
under federal due process.”       Dillon   v. Numismatic Funding Corp.,         291
N. C. 674, 676, 231 S. E. 2d 629, 630 (1977).

                                 v. BROWN
                            Opinion of the Court


1952 decision in      Perkins v. Benguet        Consol. Mining Co. re
mains “[t]he textbook case of general jurisdiction appropri
ately exercised over a foreign corporation that has not con
sented to suit in the forum.”           Donahue v. Far Eastern Air
Transport Corp., 652 F. 2d 1032, 1037 (CADC 1981).
   Sued in Ohio, the defendant in            Perkins    was a Philippine
mining corporation that had ceased activities in the Philip
pines during World War II.            To the extent that the company
was conducting any business during and immediately after
the Japanese occupation of the Philippines, it was doing so
in Ohio: The corporation’s president maintained his of ce
there, kept the company  les in that of ce, and supervised
from the Ohio of ce “the necessarily limited wartime activi
ties of the company.”         342 U. S., at 447–448.         Although the
claim-in-suit did not arise in Ohio, this Court ruled that it
would not violate due process for Ohio to adjudicate the con
troversy.     Ibid.; see Keeton       v. Hustler Magazine, Inc.,          465
U. S. 770, 779–780, n. 11 (1984) (Ohio’s exercise of general
jurisdiction was permissible in Perkins because “Ohio was
the corporation’s principal, if temporary, place of business”).
   We next addressed the exercise of general jurisdiction
over an out-of-state corporation over three decades later,
in  Helicopteros.       In that case, survivors of United States
citizens who died in a helicopter crash in Peru instituted
wrongful-death actions in a Texas state court against the
owner and operator of the helicopter, a Colombian corpora
tion.    The Colombian corporation had no place of business
in Texas and was not licensed to do business there.                   “Basi
cally, [the company’s] contacts with Texas consisted of send
ing its chief executive of cer to Houston for a contract-
negotiation session; accepting into its New York bank
account checks drawn on a Houston bank; purchasing helicop
ters, equipment, and training services from [a Texas enter
prise] for substantial sums; and sending personnel to [Texas]
for training.”      466 U. S., at 416.       These links to Texas, we
determined, did not “constitute the kind of continuous and
                          Cite as: 564 U. S. 915 (2011)                       929


                              Opinion of the Court


systematic general business contacts . . . found to exist in
Perkins,” and were insuf cient to support the exercise of
jurisdiction over a claim that neither “ar[o]se out of . . . no[r]
related to” the defendant’s activities in Texas.                  Id., at 415–
416 (internal quotation marks omitted).
   Helicopteros concluded that “mere purchases [made in the
forum State], even if occurring at regular intervals, are not
enough to warrant a State’s assertion of [general] jurisdic
tion over a nonresident corporation in a cause of action not
related to those purchase transactions.”                   Id.,  at 418.      We
see no reason to differentiate from the ties to Texas held
insuf cient in Helicopteros, the sales of petitioners’ tires spo
radically made in North Carolina through intermediaries.
Under the sprawling view of general jurisdiction urged by
respondents and embraced by the North Carolina Court of
Appeals, any substantial manufacturer or seller of goods
would be amenable to suit, on any claim for relief, wherever
its  products are        distributed.       But   cf.  World-Wide        Volks
wagen, 444 U. S., at 296 (every seller of chattels does not, by
virtue of the sale, “appoint the chattel his agent for service
of process”).
   Measured against Helicopteros and Perkins, North Caro
lina is not a forum in which it would be permissible to subject
petitioners to general jurisdiction.              Unlike the defendant in
Perkins,     whose      sole   wartime      business     activity    was    con
ducted in Ohio, petitioners are in no sense at home in North
Carolina.      Their attenuated connections to the State, see
supra, at 921, fall far short of the “the continuous and sys
tematic general business contacts” necessary to empower
North Carolina to entertain suit against them on claims un
related to anything that connects them to the State.                       Heli
copteros, 466 U. S., at 416.5


   5 As earlier noted, see supra, at 922, the North Carolina Court of Appeals
invoked the State’s “well-recognized interest in providing a forum in
which its citizens are able to seek redress for injuries that they have sus
tained.”    199 N. C. App., at 68, 681 S. E. 2d, at 394.   But “[g]eneral juris

   Respondents belatedly assert a “single enterprise” theory,
asking us to consolidate petitioners’ ties to North Carolina
with those of Goodyear USA and other Goodyear entities.
See Brief for Respondents 44–50.                      In effect, respondents
would have us pierce Goodyear corporate veils, at least for
jurisdictional purposes.             See Brilmayer & Paisley, Personal
Jurisdiction and Substantive Legal Relations: Corporations,
Conspiracies, and Agency, 74 Cal. L. Rev. 1, 14, 29–30 (1986)
(merging parent and subsidiary for jurisdictional purposes
requires an inquiry “comparable to the corporate law ques
tion of piercing the corporate veil”).                But see 199 N. C. App.,
at 64, 681 S. E. 2d, at 392 (North Carolina Court of Appeals
understood that petitioners are “separate corporate entities
. . . not directly responsible for the presence in North Caro
lina of tires that they had manufactured”).                        Neither below
nor in their brief in opposition to the petition for certiorari
did respondents urge disregard of petitioners’ discrete sta
tus as subsidiaries and treatment of all Goodyear entities as
a “unitary business,” so that jurisdiction over the parent
would draw in the subsidiaries as well.6                    Brief for Respond-


diction to adjudicate has in [United States] practice never been based on
the plaintiff ’s relationship to the forum.         There is nothing in [our] law
comparable to . . . article 14 of the Civil Code of France (1804) under which
the French nationality of the plaintiff is a suf cient ground for jurisdic
tion.”   von Mehren & Trautman 1137; see Clermont & Palmer, Exorbitant
Jurisdiction, 58 Me. L. Rev. 474, 492–495 (2006) (French law permitting
plaintiff-based jurisdiction is rarely invoked in the absence of other sup
porting factors).     When a defendant’s act outside the forum causes injury
in  the   forum,   by   contrast,   a plaintiff ’s residence    in  the   forum   may
strengthen the case for the exercise of speci c jurisdiction.             See  Calder
v. Jones, 465 U. S. 783, 788 (1984); von Mehren & Trautman 1167–1173.
   6 In the brief they  led in the North Carolina Court of Appeals, respond
ents stated that petitioners were part of “integrated world-wide efforts
to design, manufacture, market and sell their           tires in the United States,
including in North Carolina.”        App. 485 (emphasis added).        See also Brief
in Opposition 18.      Read in context, that assertion was offered in support
of a narrower proposition: The distribution of petitioners’ tires in North

Carolina, respondents maintained, demonstrated petitioners’ own “calcu
lated and deliberate efforts to take advantage of the North Carolina mar
ket.”   App. 485.     As already explained, see supra, at 929, even regularly
occurring sales of a product in a State do not justify the exercise of juris
diction over a claim unrelated to those sales.

     CERTIORARI          TO  THE     SUPREME        COURT      OF   CALIFORNIA
  No.   85-693.     Argued November         5,  1986-Decided       February    24,  1987
Petitioner   manufactures      tire  valve  assemblies    in Japan    and   sells them   to
   several tire  manufacturers,      including   Cheng Shin     Rubber    Industrial   Co.
   (Cheng    Shin).    The sales    to  Cheng    Shin,   which   amounted to      at  least
   100,000   assemblies    annually   from   1978 to   1982,  took place   in Taiwan,    to
   which   the  assemblies were      shipped    from Japan.       Cheng    Shin   incorpo-
   rates  the  assemblies into    its finished   tires, which   it sells throughout the
   world,   including   the  United    States,   where   20  percent    of its sales  take
   place  in California.     Affidavits   indicated   that petitioner    was  aware    that
   tires incorporating its      assemblies    would    end  up   in California,   but,   on
   the  other hand,    that  it never   contemplated     that its  sales  to Cheng    Shin
   in Taiwan    would   subject it   to lawsuits    in California.     Nevertheless,     in
   1979,  a  product   liability suit  was   brought    in California    Superior    Court
   arising  from a motorcycle       accident allegedly     caused by    defects  in  a tire
   manufactured      by Cheng Shin,     which   in turn filed a cross-complaint seek-
   ing indemnification     from   petitioner.    Although     the  main   suit was even-
   tually  settled   and   dismissed,    the Superior      Court    denied   petitioner's
   motion   to quash   the summons      issued against it.     The State    Court   of Ap-
   peal  then ordered    that the summons       be  quashed,   but   the State   Supreme
   Court   reversed,    finding   that  petitioner's    intentional   act  of placing    its
   assemblies    into  the stream     of commerce      by  delivering    them   to  Cheng
   Shin  in  Taiwan,    coupled   with   its awareness      that  some of    them   would
   eventually   reach   California,   were   sufficient  to support    state  court juris-
   diction under    the  Due   Process   Clause.
Held: The judgment        is reversed,    and  the  case  is remanded.
39  Cal. 3d  35,  702  P. 2d  543,  reversed    and  remanded.
     JUSTICE     O'CONNOR,      delivered   the  opinion   of the Court     as to  Parts  I
   and  II-B,  concluding    that  the state   court's  exercise   of personal jurisdic-
   tion over   petitioner would     be unreasonable      and  unfair  in violation of the
   Due   Process   Clause.     Pp.  113-116.
        (a)  The  burden    imposed on     petitioner   by the  exercise   of state court
  jurisdiction   would be    severe,   since  petitioner   would be required      not only
   to traverse   the distance   between Japan and       California, but also to    submit

     burdens           should         have       significant           weight national in    assessing           the     reasonableness
     of   extending personal                      jurisdiction             over                         borders.              Pp.      113-114.
              (b)    The      interests           of   Cheng Shin               and      the     forum State              in the       exercise
     of jurisdiction               over      petitioner            would        be     slight,       and would              be    insufficient
     to   justify is whether the  heavy        burdens            placed        on     petitioner.               The       only      surviving

     ese     corporation              on    the     bases of a           sale     made         in   Taiwan          and      a shipment              of

     that      the     dispute          is primarily              about       indemnity              rather         than      the     safety         of

                          OCTOBER      TERM,    1986


                            Opinion of the  Court                    480 U.  S.
California   in  and  for  the  County     of Solano.     Zurcher     alleged
that the   1978 accident     was   caused    by a sudden     loss  of air  and


                 in  the  rear   tire  of the   motorcycle,     and   alleged
an explosion
that   the  motorcycle     tire,  tube,   and   sealant    were   defective.
Zurcher's     complaint    named,     inter alia, Cheng       Shin   Rubber
Industrial    Co.,   Ltd.   (Cheng    Shin),   the  Taiwanese      manufac-
turer   of the tube.     Cheng    Shin in turn    filed  a cross-complaint
seeking indemnification from its           codefendants     and from     peti-
tioner,  Asahi Metal      Industry    Co.,   Ltd.  (Asahi),   the manufac-
turer   of the  tube's valve assembly.          Zurcher's    claims against
Cheng Shin and the other defendants were                eventually    settled
and   dismissed, leaving        only  Cheng Shin's       indemnity      action
against   Asahi.
   California's long-arm       statute   authorizes     the exercise    of ju-
risdiction   "on any basis not inconsistent         with the Constitution
of this  state or   of the   United    States."     Cal.   Civ.  Proc.   Code
Ann.    §410.10    (West    1973).     Asahi    moved     to quash     Cheng
Shin's   service   of summons,      arguing    the State   could   not exert
jurisdiction    over it consistent with      the Due Process       Clause    of
the  Fourteenth      Amendment.
   In  relation    to the   motion,    the   following    information     was
submitted     by   Asahi and      Cheng    Shin.     Asahi    is a Japanese
corporation.       It manufactures      tire  valve   assemblies    in Japan
and sells   the assemblies      to Cheng     Shin,   and  to  several   other
tire  manufacturers,       for   use as components         in  finished    tire
tubes.     Asahi's    sales   to Cheng     Shin   took   place   in  Taiwan.
The    shipments     from Asahi      to  Cheng     Shin   were    sent   from
Japan to Taiwan.          Cheng Shin bought        and   incorporated     into
its tire  tubes   150,000   Asahi   valve   assemblies in     1978;   500,000
in  1979;  500,000 in    1980;  100,000    in 1981;  and   100,000   in  1982.
Sales   to Cheng     Shin  accounted     for  1.24  percent   of Asahi's in-
come    in 1981   and   0.44  percent    in 1982.     Cheng    Shin   alleged
that   approximately       20   percent     of  its  sales  in  the   United
States   are  in California.      Cheng Shin purchases         valve assem-
blies   from   other   suppliers    as  well,   and   sells  finished   tubes
throughout      the world.

 102                                Opinion    of the Court
    In   1983    an   attorney       for Cheng        Shin    conducted         an   informal
examination          of the     valve     stems      of the    tire   tubes     sold    in   one
cycle     store    in Solano      County.          The    attorney       declared      that    of
the    approximately           115    tire   tubes     in   the   store,     97   were     pur-
portedly       manufactured           in   Japan     or Taiwan, circledand     of those      97,
21   valve     stems were          marked with the                         letter    "A",    ap-
parently       Asahi's      trademark.            Of   the    21   Asahi valve          stems,
 12 were      incorporated          into Cheng        Shin    tire   tubes.        The store
contained        41   other of Cheng  otherShin      tubes     that    incorporated Declarationthe
valve      assemblies                         manufacturers.                                   of

poena, App.          to   Brief for      Respondent          5-6.       An    affidavit     of a
manager of Cheng               Shin whose        duties     included the purchasing
of   component          parts     stated:     "'In     discussions        with     Asahi     re-
garding       the   purchase        of valve      stem      assemblies        the   fact    that
my     Company          sells   tubes      throughout         the    world     and     specifi-
cally    the   United       States     has been        discussed.          I  am    informed
and    believe      that    Asahi was         fully    aware      that    valve     stem     as-
semblies        sold    to   my    Company and             to   others      would      end    up
throughout         the United         States and       in California."'           39   Cal.   3d
35, 48, n.      4,  702 P.     2d 543,     549-550,       n.  4 (1985).        An    affidavit
of the      president       of Asahi,       on   the other        hand,      declared       that
Asahi      "'has    never      contemplated           that    its  limited     sales    of tire
valves      to  Cheng       Shin    in  Taiwan       would      subject      it to   lawsuits
in   California."'          Ibid.      The record         does    not   include      any    con-
tract    between        Cheng       Shin    and Asahi.           Tr.    of Oral     Arg.     24.
    Primarily        on   the basis of the         above      information,         the   Supe-
rior     Court      denied      the    motion       to   quash      summons,          stating:
"Asahi      obviously does           business      on   an   international         scale.      It
is not unreasonable             that    they defend         claims of defect          in their
product       on an international           scale."       Order      Denying Motion            to

based      on   an   act   of   the   defendant,         the    Court     in   World-Wide
Volkswagen          Corp. v. Woodson,              444 U.      S.286      (1980),    rejected
the assertion         that    a consumer's unilateral               act   of bringing        the
defendant's product              into the forum          State was a sufficient con-
stitutional      basis for      personal jurisdiction              over the defendant.
It had     been     argued      in   World-Wide          Volkswagen           that    because
an automobile            retailer      and    its   wholesale        distributor         sold    a
product       mobile      by    design      and     purpose,        they     could     foresee
being     haled     into    court    in   the   distant States          into    which      their
customers might             drive.        The    Court      rejected       this   concept      of
foreseeability         as an      insufficient       basis     for   jurisdiction        under
the    Due     Process      Clause.         Id.,   at   295-296.          The     Court      dis-
claimed,       however,          the    idea     that    "foreseeability           is   wholly
irrelevant"        to   personal        jurisdiction,         concluding         that    "[t]he
forum State         does     not exceed        its  powers       under the        Due     Proc-
ess   Clause      if it   asserts     personal       jurisdiction        over     a  corpora-
tion    that   delivers       its  products        into   the stream          of commerce
with    the expectation           that    they will      be   purchased         by   consum-
ers   in   the forum        State."        Id.,   at 297-298         (citation     omitted).

 otherwise            solicit       business          in    California.                It   did     not     create,

       A     consideration                      of these              factors in                the present case                           clearly
 reveals             the        unreasonableness                              of the           assertion                of jurisdiction
 over Asahi,                    even          apart          from the question                              of the placement                           of

minished.                      The        Supreme                 Court            of California                    argued              that the

was          overly             broad.                 The          dispute              between                 Cheng              Shin           and

standards.            Moreover,         it is  not at      all  clear    at this     point that
 California       law should          govern       the    question       whether         a  Japa-
nese     corporation          should      indemnify         a  Taiwanese          corporation
 on the basis        of a sale     made in Taiwan             and a shipment of goods

Asahi's      components           undoubtedly           creates      an   additional       deter-
rent    to the manufacture               of unsafe       components;          however,        sim-
ilar   pressures will          be placed       on   Asahi by the purchasers                  of its
 components as             long    as   those     who      use    Asahi      components           in
their final      products,        and    sell those       products in        California,        are

    World-Wide            Volkswagen           also     admonished           courts      to   take
into consideration             the interests         of the "several          States,"      in ad-
dition     to the forum         State,     in the efficient judicial             resolution       of
the dispute         and the       advancement           of substantive           policies.        In
the    present       case,    this   advice      calls    for   a  court    to consider         the
procedural          and    substantive          policies      of  other      nations whose
interests       are    affected by         the   assertion        of jurisdiction          by   the
 California       court.        The     procedural         and    substantive         interests
 of  other      nations       in  a   state     court's assertion            of   jurisdiction
 over     an   alien     defendant         will    differ     from case         to   case.        In
 every     case,     however, those            interests,       as   well    as   the   Federal
 Government's            interest      in its foreign        relations      policies,      will be
 best    served       by   a   careful     inquiry       into    the    reasonableness of
 the assertion         of jurisdiction         in the     particular       case,    and an      un-
 willingness to          find the     serious burdens             on   an   alien    defendant
 outweighed          by    minimal       interests       on   the    part    of the     plaintiff
 or the    forum State.             "Great      care and       reserve      should      be exer-
 cised when extending                our notions        of personal jurisdiction               into

minimum       contacts   between      the  forum    State   and   the retailer
or  distributor.       Id.,  at 295-296.       The    Court   then   carefully
explained:
      "[T]his    is not to say,      of  course,    that   foreseeability      is
      wholly irrelevant.         But  the foreseeability      that is   critical
      to due   process    analysis    is not  the  mere    likelihood    that   a
      product    will find   its way into    the   forum    State.     Rather,
      it is that the defendant's       conduct and     connection with the
      forum    State    are  such   that   he should     reasonably      antici-
      pate   being   haled   into  Court    there."     Id.,  at  297.
The Court      reasoned    that when      a corporation     may    reasonably
anticipate    litigation   in a particular    forum,    it cannot claim     that
such litigation    is unjust or unfair,     because     it "can  act to  allevi-
ate  the  risk  of burdensome litigation         by procuring insurance,
passing    the  expected     costs   on  to  consumers,      or,  if the  risks
are  too great,    severing    its connection     with the State."        Ibid.
   To  illustrate   the   point,  the   Court   contrasted     the   foreseea-
bility of litigation    in a State to which       a consumer     fortuitously
transports     a  defendant's product        (insufficient    contacts) with
the  foreseeability      of litigation   in  a  State   where     the  defend-
ant's   product    was   regularly     sold   (sufficient   contacts).      The
Court    stated:
      "Hence     if the  sale of a product      of a manufacturer       or  dis-
      tributor    such as    Audi    or  Volkswagen        is not   simply    an
      isolated    occurrence,     but arises     from    the   efforts   of  the
      manufacturer       or   distributor    to  serve,    directly   or indi-
      rectly, the   market     for its product in other States,        it is not
      unreasonable      to  subject   it to suit in one    of those States     if
      its  allegedly    defective    merchandise       has   there   been    the
      source    of injury    to  its owner    or  to  others.      The   forum
      State   does   not  exceed    its powers under       the  Due    Process
      Clause    if it asserts   personal    jurisdiction    over a corpora-
      tion  that   delivers    its products     into   the  stream     of  com-
      merce    with the    expectation that they         will  be purchased

       (emphasis      added).
The    Court     concluded      its   illustration     by   referring     to   Gray
v.  American        Radiator &        Standard Sanitary Corp.,               22   Ill.
2d   432,    176   N.   E.  2d    761   (1961),    a  well-known        stream-of-
commerce case          in which     the   Illinois   Supreme      Court     applied
the theory     to  assert jurisdiction       over a component-parts            man-
ufacturer     that   sold  no   components       directly    in  Illinois,  but   did
sell  them     to  a  manufacturer         who   incorporated them            into   a
final product      that  was    sold  in Illinois.     444   U.  S.,  at  297-298.
   The    Court    in World-Wide Volkswagen               thus   took   great   care
to  distinguish     "between      a case    involving     goods    which    reach    a
distant     State    through      a   chain    of  distribution       and    a  case
involving     goods     which    reach    the   same    State    because      a  con-
sumer     ...took them there."             Id.,  at 306-307      (BRENNAN,        J.,
dissenting).3        The California         Supreme       Court     took note       of
this   distinction,     and   correctly     concluded      that   our   holding    in
World-Wide        Volkswagen        preserved       the   stream-of-commerce
theory.       See   App.    to  Pet.    for  Cert.    C-9,    and   n.  3,  C-13--
C-15;     cf.  Comment,         Federalism,        Due    Process,      and    Mini-
mum      Contacts:     World-Wide         Volkswagen        Corp v.     Woodson,

    In dissent,  I argued that the    distinction was without    constitutional   sig-
nificance, because   in my view the foreseeability     that a  customer would use
a product    in a distant  State  was a    sufficient basis  for jurisdiction.    444
U.  S., at  306-307,   and nn.   11, 12.   See also   id., at 315   (MARSHALL,     J.,
dissenting)   ("I cannot  agree   that jurisdiction   is necessarily  lacking   if the
product enters the State     not through   the channels   of distribution but in the
course of its intended    use by  the consumer"); id.,    at 318-319 (BLACKMUN,
J., dissenting)  ("[F]oreseeable    use in  another  State  seems   to me little  dif-
ferent  from  foreseeable   resale  in another   State").    But  I do  not read  the
decision  in World-Wide     Volkswagen     to establish  a  per se rule against   the
exercise  of jurisdiction  where   the  contacts  arise  from  a consumer's    use of
the  product   in a given  State,  but  only  a rule against   jurisdiction  in cases
involving "one,   isolated occurrence    [of consumer use,   amounting to] ...the
fortuitous  circumstance    ....  ."  Id., at 295.    See  Hedrick v. Daiko Shoji

      In this              case,           the        facts          found             by       the        California                   Supreme

found            that          "[a]lthough                    Asahi             did        not        design              or      control             the

                                  v.  HALL        ET   AL.


          CERTIORARI          TO   THE    SUPREME         COURT       OF   TEXAS
     No.  82-1127.      Argued     November      8,  1983-Decided       April   24,  1984
Petitioner,    a  Colombian      corporation,     entered    into a   contract   to  provide
   helicopter    transportation     for  a Peruvian     consortium,     the   alter  ego  of a
   joint venture    that had its headquarters        in Houston,    Tex.,   during the con-
   sortium's    construction     of a pipeline   in  Peru   for a  Peruvian    state-owned
   oil company.       Petitioner   has  no  place of business     in Texas and     never has
   been   licensed   to do business    there.    Its only contacts     with the   State con-
   sisted  of  sending    its chief  executive    officer  to  Houston    to  negotiate    the
   contract   with   the consortium, accepting        into  its New    York   bank   account
   checks    drawn    by  the  consortium      on a  Texas bank,      purchasing     helicop-
   ters,  equipment,      and  training   services   from   a Texas    manufacturer,      and
    sending personnel      to that manufacturer's       facilities for training.      After   a
   helicopter    owned    by   petitioner   crashed    in Peru, resulting      in the death
    of respondents'     decedents-United         States   citizens   who   were    employed
   by   the  consortium-respondents           instituted   wrongful-death       actions   in  a
    Texas   state  court   against   the  consortium,     the  Texas manufacturer,         and
   petitioner.     Denying     petitioner's    motion    to dismiss   the  actions for    lack
    of in  personam jurisdiction over it, the            trial  court   entered    judgment
    against  petitioner on    a jury   verdict in   favor  of respondents.        The  Texas
    Court   of Civil Appeals      reversed,    holding   that  in  personam jurisdiction
    over   petitioner   was    lacking,   but   in turn   was   reversed     by   the  Texas
    Supreme     Court.
Held:    Petitioner's    contacts with Texas       were    insufficient  to  satisfy   the  re-
    quirements     of the   Due   Process    Clause of    the   Fourteenth     Amendment
    and  hence    to allow   the  Texas    court  to  assert   in  personamjurisdiction
    over petitioner.      The   one  trip to  Houston by     petitioner's   chief executive
    officer for the purpose     of negotiating    the transportation      services contract
    cannot be   regarded     as a contact   of a "continuous     and  systematic"     nature,
    and  thus  cannot   support    an  assertion   of general   jurisdiction.      Similarly,
    petitioner's   acceptance     of checks   drawn    on  a Texas bank      is of negligible
    significance   for  purposes     of  determining     whether     petitioner    had   suffi-
    cient  contacts   in Texas.     Nor   were   petitioner's   purchases     of helicopters
    and  equipment      from   the  Texas    manufacturer       and  the   related training
    trips  a  sufficient  basis   for  the  Texas    court's assertion      of jurisdiction.

   a State's  assertion   of in personam jurisdiction     over  a  nonresident   cor-
   poration  in a cause   of action not related  to the  purchases.    And the   fact
   that  petitioner  sent  personnel   to Texas   for training  in  connection   with
   the purchases    did  not  enhance   the  nature  of petitioner's  contacts with
   Texas.    Pp.  413-419.

    JUSTICE      BLACKMUN         delivered      the   opinion    of  the    Court.
    We   granted     certiorari    in this  case,   460 U.    S.  1021   (1983),   to
 decide    whether the       Supreme       Court    of Texas     correctly     ruled
 that   the  contacts     of a   foreign    corporation with         the  State    of
 Texas    were    sufficient    to  allow    a Texas     state   court   to  assert
jurisdiction     over    the  corporation      in a  cause of action      not  aris-
 ing out   of  or related     to the   corporation's activities        within    the
 State.                                    I

                                     Opinion     of the Court                            466 U.     S.
January        26,    1976,     a  helicopter        owned        by    Helicol      crashed        in
Peru.        Four      United       States       citizens     were      among        those      who
lost   their     lives    in  the    accident.          Respondents            are    the    survi-
vors    and     representatives            of the     four decedents.
   At    the    time    of the     crash,     respondents'           decedents         were     em-
ployed      by Consorcio,           a  Peruvian        consortium,          and     were     work-
ing    on    a   pipeline       in   Peru.         Consorcio         is   the (WSH).1ego Thealter   of



a  joint venture            named Williams-Sedco-Horn
venture        had     its  headquarters            in   Houston,         Tex.        Consorcio
had     been      formed to          enable       the     venturers         to   enter      into     a
contract       with     Petro     Peru,      the   Peruvian         state-owned          oil   com-
pany.        Consorcio         was    to   construct        a  pipeline       for   Petro      Peru
running        from      the    interior      of   Peru      westward          to    the    Pacific
Ocean.          Peruvian         law    forbade        construction          of   the    pipeline
by any      non-Peruvian            entity.
    Consorcio/WSH2                needed        helicopters          to   move       personnel,
materials,         and     equipment          into    and     out     of   the    construction
area.        In   1974,     upon      request        of   Consorcio/WSH,               the     chief
executive        officer     of   Helicol,      Francisco         Restrepo,         flew    to   the
United       States     and    conferred        in Houston with             representatives
of   the    three     joint     venturers.            At    that     meeting,        there      was
a  discussion        of prices,        availability,        working         conditions,        fuel,
supplies,        and     housing.          Restrepo         represented           that     Helicol
could     have      the    first   helicopter         on   the    job    in   15   days.        The
Consorcio/WSH               representatives              decided       to   accept      the     con-
tract     proposed          by     Restrepo.             Helicol       began        performing
before      the    agreement           was     formally        signed       in   Peru     on    No-
vember        11,    1974.1       The     contract       was     written       in   Spanish        on

official  government       stationery     and   provided     that   the  resi-
dence    of all  the  parties    would be     Lima,     Peru.     It  further
stated   that controversies      arising out    of the contract     would be
submitted     to  the  jurisdiction     of Peruvian     courts.      In  addi-
tion,  it provided    that   Consorcio/WSH        would    make    payments
to  Helicol's   account   with   the   Bank   of America      in New York
City.     App.   12a.
   Aside    from   the   negotiation     session    in  Houston     between
Restrepo     and the   representatives       of Consorcio/WSH,        Helicol
had  other contacts with Texas.           During the years       1970-1977,
it  purchased     helicopters     (approximately        80%    of  its fleet),
spare   parts,   and   accessories     for  more    than   $4  million   from
Bell   Helicopter     Company      in  Fort   Worth.       In  that   period,
Helicol sent prospective        pilots to Fort Worth for training          and
to ferry the    aircraft to South America.           It also  sent manage-
ment    and   maintenance      personnel     to  visit  Bell  Helicopter     in
Fort Worth      during the    same period      in order to receive     "plant
familiarization"     and   for  technical    consultation.       Helicol   re-
ceived   into  its-New    York    City and    Panama City,        Fla., bank
accounts    over   $5   million in   payments      from    Consorcio/WSH
drawn    upon    First  City National      Bank   of Houston.
   Beyond     the  foregoing,    there    have   been   no  other   business
contacts    between     Helicol    and  the   State   of  Texas.      Helicol
never has been       authorized    to  do business    in Texas    and   never
has had    an  agent   for the   service   of process within      the  State.
It never   has performed helicopter operations             in Texas or sold
any   product    that  reached     Texas,   never    solicited  business     in
Texas,    never    signed any     contract    in  Texas,    never    had   any
employee      based   there,   and   never    recruited    an  employee      in
Texas.      In  addition,    Helicol   never    has   owned    real   or  per-
sonal property in Texas        and never has maintained          an office or
establishment      there.      Helicol  has maintained       no   records    in
Texas    and   has  no  shareholders      in that   State.'    None    of the

       HELICOPTEROS            NACIONALES          DE  COLOMBIA        v. HALL       415


408                             Opinion    of the Court
nese    occupation of        the  Philippine       Islands,    the   president      and
general      manager       of a    Philippine      mining      corporation       main-
tained     an   office   in  Ohio    from    which he       conducted       activities
on   behalf    of  the   company.          He   kept    company       files  and held
directors'     meetings       in  the   office,   carried     on   correspondence
relating     to  the   business,     distributed       salary    checks     drawn     on
two    active    Ohio    bank    accounts,     engaged       an  Ohio    bank    to  act
as  transfer     agent,    and   supervised       policies   dealing with the        re-
habilitation      of the   corporation's       properties      in  the  Philippines.
In    short,    the    foreign     corporation,         through      its  president,
"ha[d]    been    carrying     on   in  Ohio   a continuous        and   systematic,
but    limited,    part    of  its  general      business,"      and   the    exercise
of   general     jurisdiction       over    the    Philippine      corporation        by
an    Ohio    court     was    "reasonable        and    just."      342    U.   S.,   at
438, 445.
    All  parties     to  the   present     case    concede      that   respondents'
claims     against    Helicol     did  not   "arise    out   of,"  and    are   not  re-
lated to,      Helicol's    activities     within Texas."0          We    thus    must
   "0 See Brief for Respondents      14; Tr. of Oral Arg. 26-27,     30-31.     Because
the parties    have  not  argued   any   relationship   between    the  cause  of  action
and   Helicol's contacts   with the State   of Texas,   we,  contrary to the dissent's
implication,   post,  at 419-420,    assert  no  "view"   with respect    to that  issue.
   The   dissent suggests     that  we  have   erred  in  drawing   no  distinction   be-
tween    controversies    that  "relate  to"  a defendant's    contacts   with  a forum
and   those  that  "arise  out of"  such contacts.     Post, at 420.     This  criticism
is somewhat     puzzling, for the dissent     goes  on  to urge  that, for purposes    of
determining     the   constitutional validity     of an  assertion   of  specific  juris-
diction,  there   really  should be   no  distinction   between    the  two.    Post, at
427-428.
   We   do not  address the    validity  or consequences     of such a distinction    be-
cause   the  issue  has  not  been   presented    in this  case.    Respondents     have
made no argument       that their cause of action    either arose out of or is related
to  Helicol's  contacts  with the State    of Texas.     Absent    any  briefing  on the
issue,  we  decline  to  reach  the questions    (1) whether the terms     "arising out
of"   and  "related   to" describe different      connections    between     a cause   of
action and a     defendant's   contacts   with a   forum,   and   (2) what   sort  of tie
between    a cause of action and     a defendant's   contacts   with a forum is neces-
sary  to a determination     that either connection     exists.   Nor do we    reach the
                                                                                                         OCTOBER                                            TERM,                                1983

third   person   is not an   appropriate      consideration when       deter-
mining     whether     a  defendant     has   sufficient   contacts    with   a

   The   Texas     Supreme     Court    focused    on  the   purchases     and
the related    training trips     in finding contacts     sufficient  to sup-
 port an   assertion   of jurisdiction.      We   do not agree     with that
assessment,      for the  Court's opinion in Rosenberg Bros. & Co.
 v. Curtis Brown Co.,       260   U.  S. 516 (1923)    (Brandeis,    J., for a
unanimous      tribunal),    makes clear that purchases          and  related
 trips,  standing    alone,   are  not  a  sufficient   basis  for a   State's
 assertion   of jurisdiction.
   The   defendant     in Rosenberg was        a  small  retailer   in Tulsa,
 Okla.,  who   dealt in   men's   clothing and     furnishings.      It never
 had applied    for a license   to do  business in    New York, nor had
it at  any   time  authorized     suit to  be  brought    against    it there.
 It never    had   an  established    place   of business     in New     York
and   never    regularly carried      on   business    in that   State.     Its
 only  connection     with   New    York   was    that  it purchased     from
 New    York wholesalers         a large portion      of  the  merchandise
 sold in its  Tulsa store.     The   purchases     sometimes     were made
by   correspondence        and   sometimes       through     visits  to  New
 York by     an  officer  of the  defendant.       The   Court    concluded:
 "Visits  on   such  business,    even    if occurring    at regular    inter-
 vals,  would    not  warrant     the  inference     that  the   corporation
 was   present    within    the  jurisdiction    of  [New     York]."      Id.,

     This       Court         in InternationalShoe acknowledged and                                                    did not

In accordance                  with        Rosenberg, we                     hold      that      mere         purchases,
even        if occurring              at    regular intervals,                      are not          enough           to    war-

the     fact      that      Helicol          sent       personnel             into      Texas          for training              in
connection               with the           purchase             of helicopters                 and      equipment               in
that       State        in     any      way        enhanced              the      nature          of Helicol's               con-
tacts       with       Texas.              The       training was                a   part       of the        package            of
goods         and       services purchased                          by     Helicol          from         Bell      Helicop-

326     U.    S.,    at    318.       Arguably,           therefore,          Rosenberg also                stands       for    the
proposition that mere purchases                            are not a sufficient basis for either general

need      not     decide       the    continuing validity                 of Rosenberg with                  respect        to   an

issue        is                    implausible               nor unexpected.
     What          is   troubling            about         the Court's               opinion,           however,             are
the      implications               that       might         be     drawn          from        the      way in          which

ents suggest that the Court hold that the                                State of Texas had personal juris-
diction       over     Helicol       under       a  doctrine        of "jurisdiction by                necessity."            See

ever, that respondents failed to carry their burden of showing that all three
defendants           could      not    be    sued      together        in   a   single forum.               It  is   not    clear
from       the     record,        for example,              whether         suit     could       have       been brought

consider         adoption        of a doctrine           of jurisdiction            by    necessity-a            potentially
far-reaching           modification            of existing         law-in         the    absence         of a    more       com-

underlying     cause   of action   does   "not  aris[e]   out  of or   relat[e]
to the   corporation's      activities within      the State."       Ante,    at
409.    Then,    the  Court   relies  on  a  1923   decision in Rosenberg
Bros. & Co. v. Curtis Brown Co.,            260 U.    S. 516,   without con-
sidering whether that case retains any validity              after our more
recent   pronouncements        concerning     the  permissible      reach   of a
State's   jurisdiction.       By   posing    and   deciding    the   question
presented     in  this  manner,      I fear   that   the   Court    is  saying
more    than it   realizes   about   constitutional     limitations     on  the
potential   reach    of in  personam jurisdiction.            In   particular,
by relying on a precedent         whose premises       have   long   been dis-
carded,    and  by   refusing to    consider    any distinction      between
controversies      that   "relate   to"   a  defendant's      contacts    with
the  forum and causes        of action    that  "arise   out   of"  such   con-
tacts,  the Court    may be    placing   severe limitations       on the type
and   amount     of  contacts    that   will   satisfy   the  constitutional
minimum.
   In  contrast,    I believe   that   the  undisputed      contacts    in  this
case  between      petitioner    Helicol   and   the   State   of Texas     are
sufficiently   important,     and   sufficiently    related   to  the   under-
lying  cause of action,      to  make    it fair  and   reasonable     for  the
State   to   assert   personal     jurisdiction     over    Helicol    for  the
wrongful-death        actions    filed  by   the   respondents.          Given
that  Helicol    has   purposefully      availed    itself  of  the   benefits
and   obligations    of  the  forum, and      given   the   direct   relation-
ship  between     the underlying cause       of action and     Helicol's   con-
tacts  with   the   forum,    maintenance      of this   suit  in  the   Texas
courts   "does   not   offend   [the]  'traditional    notions   of fair   play

     IThe         Court         leaves         open the             question whether the                             decision           in Rosenberg
was intended                   to address               any       constitutional                 limits         on an         assertion            of "spe-

Rosenberg, however,                              it is that the               Court         was concerned                     only with             general
jurisdiction                over       the       corporate              defendant.                   See       260      U.      S.,     at     517      ("The

                           BRENNAN,    J., dissenting                 466  U. S.


 Reasoning     by analogy,      the  Court   in  this  case  concludes     that
 Helicol's contacts     with the    State of Texas     are  no  more signifi-
cant than the purchases         made by the defendant          in Rosenberg.
The   Court    makes no     attempt,    however,     to  ascertain    whether
the   narrow    view   of in  personam jurisdiction          adopted    by  the
 Court   in  Rosenberg      comports     with   "the   fundamental       trans-
formation     of our    national   economy"      that   has  occurred     since
 1923.    McGee     v. InternationalLife        Ins. Co.,    355   U.  S.  220,
222-223     (1957).     See   also  World-Wide Volkswagen             Corp.    v.
 Woodson,      444   U.  S. 286,     292-293     (1980);    id.,  at  308-309
(BRENNAN,        J.,  dissenting);    Hanson       v. Denckla,      357  U.   S.
235,   250-251    (1958);   id., at  260  (Black,   J.,  dissenting).      This
failure,   in my   view,    is fatal to  the  Court's    analysis.
   The    vast   expansion      of our national      economy      during    the
past   several    decades    has  provided     the  primary     rationale    for
expanding       the   permissible     reach    of   a  State's   jurisdiction
under    the Due    Process Clause.         By  broadening      the type    and
amount     of business     opportunities     available    to participants     in
interstate    and   foreign   commerce,      our   economy     has  increased
the   frequency     with   which    foreign   corporations      actively   pur-
sue commercial        transactions throughout          the  various    States.
 In  turn,   it  has   become     both    necessary     and,    in  my   view,
desirable     to  allow   the   States   more    leeway     in  bringing    the
activities   of these    nonresident     corporations      within   the  scope
of their   respective    jurisdictions.
   This   is  neither   a  unique    nor  a  novel   idea.     As  the   Court
first  noted   in  1957:
      "[M]any      commercial      transactions      touch     two byor themore
      States    and   may    involve     parties   separated                full
      continent.        With     this    increasing      nationalization      of
      commerce       has  come     a great   increase     in the   amount     of
      business     conducted     by   mail  across    state  lines.     At  the


Court's resuscitation of Rosenberg, therefore,    should have no bearing upon
any forum's assertion   ofjurisidiction over claims that arise out of or relate
to a defendant's   contacts with the State.

                           BRENNAN,     J., dissenting                  466  U.  S.


that  employed       the   decedents.       Specifically,     the   respondent
Hall claimed      in  her    original   complaint      that   "Helicol     is . . .
legally   responsible      for  its  own    negligence      through its      pilot
employee."        App.    6a.    Viewed     in  light  of  these    allegations,
the  contacts     between     Helicol    and   the   State   of  Texas    are   di-
rectly   and   significantly     related    to  the  underlying      claim   filed
by   the respondents.           The    negotiations      that   took    place    in
Texas    led  to  the  contract    in  which Helicol       agreed    to  provide
the  precise    transportation       services     that  were    being used       at
the  time   of the   crash.      Moreover,      the  helicopter     involved     in
the  crash    was   purchased       by  Helicol    in  Texas,    and    the  pilot
whose    negligence was        alleged    to have    caused     the   crash   was
actually   trained    in Texas.       See  Tr.   Of  Oral   Arg.   5, 22.    This
is simply    not  a  case,  therefore,     in which    a  state   court   has as-
serted   jurisdiction     over   a nonresident      defendant      on  the   basis
of wholly     unrelated     contacts     with   the   forum.       Rather, the
contacts    between      Helicol   and   the   forum    are directly      related
to the   negligence      that   was   alleged    in  the   respondent       Hall's
original   complaint.4        Because     Helicol    should    have    expected
to be  amenable      to  suit  in the   Texas    courts   for  claims    directly
related   to  these   contacts,    it is fair and reasonable to        allow the
assertion    of jurisdiction     in this   case.
   Despite    this substantial       relationship     between     the   contacts
and    the   cause    of   action,    the   Court     declines     to   consider
whether the       courts   of Texas     may    assert    specific  jurisdiction
over   this  suit.    Apparently, this       simply    reflects   a narrow      in-
terpretation     of the question      presented      for review.       See ante,
at 415-416,     n.  10.    It is nonetheless      possible    that  the   Court's
opinion    may   be   read   to imply    that   the  specific   jurisdiction     of
the  Texas    courts    is  inapplicable     because     the   cause    of action


  4 The jury  specifically found  that  "the pilot failed to keep   the helicopter
under proper    control,"  that "the  helicopter  was   flown  into a treetop   fog
condition, whereby    the vision  of the pilot was  impaired,"   that "such flying
was negligence,"    and that "such   negligence   ...  was a proximate    cause of
the crash."   See  App.   167a-168a.    On the   basis of these  findings,  Helicol
was ordered   to pay over $1 million    in damages   to the  respondents.

 presumably                               the           Court                would concede                                      that            the          specific juris-
